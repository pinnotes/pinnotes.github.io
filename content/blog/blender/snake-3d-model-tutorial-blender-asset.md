## How to Animate a Snake Along a Path in Blender 🐍✨

Ever wanted to make a snake *slither* smoothly in Blender? Whether you’re a beginner or just need a fast workflow, this guide (based on [this excellent tutorial](https://youtu.be/UROAPLMzMGg?si=cT9twAjtpeLCOvX0)) makes creating captivating path animations a breeze! Let’s get started and bring your snake to life! 🌟

***

### 🗑️ Step 1: Clean Up the Scene

- Start Blender with your default scene.
- **Delete the default cube** (`A` to select all, `Delete`).
_It’s Blender Law!_

***

### 🟫 Step 2: Add a Ground Plane

- Press `Shift + A` → Mesh → Plane.
- **Scale up** the plane (`S`, drag or enter a number) for your ground.

***

### 🐍 Step 3: Import Your Snake Model

- Press `F4` (or File → Import) to bring in your 3D snake model.
- **Not got a snake?**
Grab a free one via the tutorial’s [asset link](https://pinnotes.github.io/blog/blender/snake-3d-model-tutorial-blender-asset/)!
- **Scale down** your snake model to fit the scene (`S`, drag).

***

### 📝 Step 4: Create the Path with a Curve

1. **Add a Curve:**
    - `Shift + A` → Curve → (Pick your favorite, like Bezier or Path)
2. Hide the plane \& snake for clarity.
3. **Edit the curve:**
    - Select the curve, press `Tab` (Edit Mode).
    - Delete default points (select, `Delete`).
    - Use the pencil tool 🖊️ to *draw your own slithering path* in top view (`numpad 7`).
    - Add twists and turns for that “snake vibe”!

***

### 🧩 Step 5: Attach the Snake to the Path

- Unhide your snake.
- **Select snake model**, go to the modifiers tab.
- Add a **Curve Modifier**.
- Set the “Curve Object” to your drawn curve.
- ***Troubleshooting:***
If the snake looks weird or doesn’t follow the curve:
    - Adjust the “Deform Axis” (try X, Y, Z) until it aligns.
    - Move the snake down slightly if floating above the grid.

***

### 🎛️ Step 6: Smooth Out Movements

- **Curve too jagged?**
    - Select the curve, go to Curve Data Properties.
    - Increase “Resolution” for smoother turns.
- In Edit Mode, select sharp vertices and drag the handles (`G`) to smooth bends.
- **Extra smoothness:**
    - Right-click the curve, choose “Subdivide” for more control points.

***

### 🎞️ Step 7: Animate the Snake

- Select the snake, go to Object Properties.
- **Insert a keyframe** for Location (X-axis).
- Move a few frames forward in timeline, move snake along X-axis, and insert another keyframe.
- **Adjust animation speed:**
    - If too fast, drag the second keyframe farther on timeline.

***

### 🖼️ Step 8: Final Touches

- Scale your ground plane for the best composition.
- Lock **Y** and **Z axis** for the snake (avoid weird sliding).
- Scrub through the timeline: your snake should now *slither* smoothly along the path!
- Fix any last sharp corners in the curve for buttery motion.

***

### 🪄 That’s a Wrap! (Part 1)

Your snake is now animated along a custom path—no rigging nightmares, just smooth, easy motion! In **Part 2** (watch on YouTube), you’ll texture, light, and render your masterpiece.

***

> 💡 **Tip:** You can use this workflow for *any* object to follow curves—great for trains, cars, creatures, and more!
