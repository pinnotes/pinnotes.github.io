### 1️⃣ Get Assets \& Prep the Scene 🧴🐍🪵

- **Import your models**: bottle, snake, and wooden base. These are the building blocks of your scene.[^1]
- **Arrange them**: Place the bottle on the wooden base for a clean, commercial-ready look.[^1]
- **Pro tip**: You can download assets from the video description to follow along easily!🔗

***

### 2️⃣ Snake Setup 🐍

- **Select the snake** and adjust its size so it looks natural next to the bottle.[^1]
- **Move it** close to the bottle, where animation begins.[^1]
- **Always apply scale** (Object > Apply > Scale) to avoid weird modifier glitches later on. This keeps everything looking right!✔️

***

### 3️⃣ Curve Magic ✨

- **Add a curve object** to the scene (Shift+A > Curve > Bezier, for example).[^1]
- **Apply the Curve Modifier** to the snake via the modifiers panel.[^1]
    - In the modifier, select the new curve as the target.
- Now, **move the snake on the X-axis** and watch it follow the curve path—so cool!😮

***

### 4️⃣ Shaping the Snake’s Path 🎯

- **Edit the curve**: Go to Edit Mode with the curve selected.[^1]
    - **Extrude and rotate points** to make the curve wrap smoothly around the bottle and base for a natural, snaky movement.
- Take your time here: a smoother curve gives a more lifelike animation!🌀
- **Twist control**: Select a curve vertex, press `Ctrl+T` and rotate for fine control of the snake’s twist. Perfect for adding realism.[^1]

***

### 5️⃣ Render Settings \& Lighting 💡

- **Render Engine**: Switch from Eevee to Cycles for the best quality.[^1]
- **Device**: Opt for GPU if available, for faster rendering.[^1]
- **Viewport samples**: Lower to 20 while working to keep things responsive.[^1]
- **Denoising**: Turn it on for clean previews.[^1]

***

#### Lighting Tips

- 🎇 **Area light:** Add, scale up, and boost power for soft scene lighting.
- ✨ **Point lights:** Add one or two more to highlight the snake and bottle from various angles, adjusting power for balance.[^1]
- 🌑 **World lighting:** Lower background strength for drama and focus on the product effect.[^1]

***

### 6️⃣ Animating the Snake 🕺

- **Select the snake** object.
- **Insert keyframes** on its X position at the start and end points (timeline).[^1]
- Move the timeline slider, change the X-value, and add another keyframe to make the snake smoothly wrap along your curve.
- **Playback**: Watch as the snake gracefully twirls around the bottle—satisfying!🐍🌀

***

### 7️⃣ Camera, Action, Render! 🎬

- **Add a camera** and frame the perfect shot for your animation.[^1]
- **Render!** Your product animation is ready to shine!🏆
