The IIT Madras BS in Data Science & Applications programme is structured across four distinct levels, offering multiple entry and exit points. The course content is delivered online, though monthly quizzes and final semester exams are conducted in-person at designated centres.

Here is an overview of the structure and progression through the levels:

**Programme Structure and Levels**

1.  **Level 1: The Foundation Level**
    *   This is the initial entry point for most applicants.
    *   It comprises 8 courses: English 1, English 2, Mathematics 1, Mathematics 2, Statistics 1, Statistics 2, Computational Thinking, and Introduction to Python.
    *   Successful completion of these 8 courses is required to register for Year 2 Diploma level courses.
    *   The Foundation level accounts for 32 credits.
    *   Learners can earn a Foundation level certificate upon completion.

2.  **Level 2: Diploma Level**
    *   This level includes two distinct Diplomas: Diploma in Programming and Diploma in Data Science.
    *   **Diploma in Programming:** Consists of 6 courses (23 credits) and 2 project courses (4 credits). Courses include Database Management Systems (DBMS), Programming Data Structures and Algorithms using Python (PDSA), Java programming, System Commands, Application Development - 1, and Application Development - 2, plus project courses in Application Development.
    *   **Diploma in Data Science:** Consists of 6 courses (23 credits) and 2 project courses (4 credits). Courses include Machine Learning Foundations (MLF), Machine Learning Techniques (MLT), Machine Learning Practice (MLP), Business Data Management (BDM), Business Analytics (BA), and Tools in Data Science (TDS), plus project courses in Business Data Management and Machine Learning Practice.
    *   Each diploma comprises a total of 27 credits (23 course credits + 4 project credits).
    *   The combined Diploma level totals 54 credits.
    *   Learners can earn a Diploma in Programming, a Diploma in Data Science, or both upon completion of the respective requirements.
    *   Successful completion of **all 8 Foundation courses and the 12 Diploma level courses + 4 project courses** is necessary before registering for Year 3 Degree level courses.

3.  **Level 3: BSc Degree Level**
    *   This level requires a total of 28 credits.
    *   It includes mandatory core pairs (Software Engineering, Software Testing, Artificial Intelligence, and Deep Learning) and a mandatory course: Strategies for Professional Growth.
    *   A maximum of 4 credits can be obtained from NPTEL courses in the technical bucket.
    *   The total credits required to graduate with the BSc degree are 114. Learners become eligible for the BSc degree upon completing 114 credits according to norms.

4.  **Level 4: BS Degree Level**
    *   This is the final level, requiring a total of 28 credits.
    *   It offers the option of an Apprenticeship, allowing learners to earn 0, 4, 8, or 12 credits.
    *   It is mandatory to earn 4 credits from the HS/MG stream, which can be from NPTEL or programme electives.
    *   Mandatory completion of 2 Level 4 courses in the programming stream and 2 Level 4 courses in the data science stream is required.
    *   The total credits required to graduate with the BS degree are 142. Learners become eligible for the BS degree upon completing 142 credits.
    *   A Minor in Economics and Finance can be earned by completing 2 mandatory courses (Corporate Finance and Managerial Economics) and one elective course, credited within the 142 credits for the BS degree. The Minor can only be earned with the BS degree.

**Progression Through Levels**

*   **Entry into Foundation Level:** Applicants must generally pass a Qualifier exam. There is also a direct entry route for students who have qualified for the JEE Advanced Exams.
*   **Progression from Foundation to Diploma Level:** Requires successful completion of all courses in the Foundation level.
*   **Progression from Diploma to BSc Degree Level:** Learners who successfully complete all courses in the Foundation and Diploma programmes become eligible for admission to the degree level if they satisfy the prescribed/regulatory criteria. For students admitted to the Diploma level from May 2024 onwards, eligibility requires securing a CGPA of 6.0 or higher at the end of the two diplomas (including Foundation and Diploma courses/projects) **AND** a CGPA of 7.0 or higher specifically in all diploma-level projects.
*   **Progression from BSc to BS Degree Level:** Students who complete 114 credits as per the norms are eligible for the BSc degree and can then continue onto the BS level.

**Credit Definition:**
Credits in this programme are based on the UGC system, where **14 hours of learner engagement counts as 1 credit**. This is equivalent to 3 credits in the current IITM campus Credit system.

**Entry and Exit Points:**
The programme is designed with two entry points (Regular Entry into Foundation, JEE-based Entry into Foundation, and Direct Entry into Diploma) and four potential exit points, allowing learners to leave with course certificates, one or both diplomas, a BSc degree, or the final BS degree. It is important to note that passing the Qualifier exam allows entry into the Foundation courses, not automatic admission to a degree programme; diplomas or degrees are earned by accruing the requisite credits and satisfying mandatory criteria.
