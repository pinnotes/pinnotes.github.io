## Desmos vs GeoGebra: Feature Comparison

| Feature/Criteria | **Desmos** | **GeoGebra** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Integration** | - Integrates with Google Classroom, Coursify.me, and remote learning systems[^9].<br>- Embedding in Canvas quizzes is limited[^10].<br>- Easy sharing via direct links, no login required for students[^3]. | - Integrates with Google Classroom, Moodle, Microsoft OneNote, and other LMSs[^2].<br>- Embedding and assignment features are robust[^2].<br>- Downloadable apps for offline use[^7][^8]. |
| **Ease of Use** | - Very user-friendly and intuitive, especially for graphing functions[^4][^10].<br>- Minimal learning curve for new users.<br>- Accessible for students with disabilities[^4]. | - Powerful, but interface can feel less logical and more complex, especially for beginners[^3][^5].<br>- Geometry tools are more advanced but may require more time to master[^3][^5]. |
| **Free or Paid** | - Completely free for all core features[^6].<br>- Optional paid curriculum for schools, but calculators and classroom tools remain free[^6]. | - Also completely free for most features[^6][^8].<br>- Free downloads for desktop and mobile[^8][^14]. |
| **Interactivity** | - Highly interactive for graphing and algebra.<br>- Activity Builder for custom lessons[^1].<br>- Real-time collaboration and feedback in Desmos Classroom[^1][^9]. | - Highly interactive, especially for geometry and 3D modeling[^2][^8].<br>- Real-time collaboration in GeoGebra Classroom[^2].<br>- Supports dynamic manipulation of geometric objects. |
| **Geometry Tools** | - Basic geometry functionality, improving but less advanced than GeoGebra[^7][^3]. | - Extensive geometry tools, including construction, measurement, and proof features[^3][^7][^8]. |
| **3D Graphing** | - No true 3D graphing support. | - Full 3D graphing and modeling capabilities[^8][^14]. |
| **Algebra/Calculus** | - Excellent for graphing functions, exploring transformations, and statistics[^4][^10]. | - Strong algebra, calculus, and statistics tools; includes CAS (Computer Algebra System)[^8][^3]. |
| **Customization** | - Activity Builder allows for lesson customization and teacher collaboration[^1]. | - Highly customizable activities and applets; supports scripting, sliders, and more advanced features[^2][^8]. |
| **Accessibility** | - Designed with accessibility in mind; supports screen readers and is easy to use for all students[^4]. | - Good accessibility, but not as specifically highlighted as Desmos[^5]. |
| **Offline Use** | - Primarily web-based; mobile apps available. | - Downloadable desktop and mobile apps for offline use[^8][^14]. |
| **Community \& Sharing** | - Large educator community, easy sharing of activities and resources[^1]. | - Extensive resource library; users can share, remix, and publish their own applets[^2][^3]. |
| **Target Audience** | - Middle/high school, especially strong for algebra, functions, and statistics[^10][^13]. | - Suitable for all levels, including advanced geometry, calculus, and university-level math[^8][^13]. |

## Key Takeaways

**Desmos:**

- **Best for:** Quick, easy graphing, algebra, function visualization, and interactive classroom activities.
- **Strengths:** Intuitive interface, accessibility, free for all users, seamless sharing, strong for algebra and statistics, excellent for classroom engagement.
- **Limitations:** Geometry and 3D graphing less advanced; some LMS integrations (like Canvas quizzes) are limited[^10][^7][^3].

**GeoGebra:**

- **Best for:** Geometry, 3D modeling, advanced math topics, and creating dynamic, interactive visualizations.
- **Strengths:** Powerful geometry and 3D tools, robust integration with many LMSs, highly customizable, supports offline use, strong for calculus and proofs[^2][^8][^14].
- **Limitations:** Slightly steeper learning curve, interface can be less intuitive for beginners, occasional glitches reported[^3][^5].

## User Reviews \& Ratings

- **Desmos:** Highly rated for ease of use and classroom engagement; praised for being free and accessible[^6][^10][^13].
- **GeoGebra:** Highly rated for feature richness and versatility, especially in geometry and advanced mathematics; some users find it less intuitive at first but very powerful once learned[^5][^3][^8].

---

## Bottom Line

- **Choose Desmos** if you want a super-easy, free, and accessible tool for graphing, algebra, and interactive classroom activities.
- **Choose GeoGebra** if you need advanced geometry, 3D modeling, or want to create highly interactive and customizable math visualizations, especially for higher-level math.

Both are free, widely used, and highly respected in education. Many teachers use both, depending on the topic and classroom needs[^6][^14][^8].
