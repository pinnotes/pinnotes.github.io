## Key Calendar Concepts for Exams 📅

To excel in calendar reasoning questions for exams like SSC CHSL, focus on these essential concepts:

---

### **1. Days of the Week** 🗓️

- There are 7 days: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.
- Days repeat every 7 days, forming a cycle[^1].

---

### **2. Months of the Year** 📆

- 12 months: January to December.
- Each month has a fixed number of days (28, 29, 30, or 31)[^1].

---

### **3. Ordinary Year vs. Leap Year** 🔄

- **Ordinary Year:** 365 days (52 weeks + 1 day). That 1 extra day is called an **odd day**.
- **Leap Year:** 366 days (52 weeks + 2 days). That 2 extra days are called **odd days**.
- Leap year rule: Divisible by 4, but century years must also be divisible by 400 (e.g., 2000 is leap, 1900 is not)[^2][^3].

---

### **4. Odd Days Concept** 🤔

- **Odd days** are the extra days left after counting complete weeks in a period.
- Used to calculate the day of the week for any given date[^2][^3].
- Example: 365 days ÷ 7 = 52 weeks + 1 odd day.

---

### **5. Day Coding for Fast Calculation** 🔢

| Day | Code |
| :-- | :-- |
| Sunday | 0 |
| Monday | 1 |
| Tuesday | 2 |
| Wednesday | 3 |
| Thursday | 4 |
| Friday | 5 |
| Saturday | 6 |

- Use these codes to quickly find the day after a certain number of days[^2].

---

### **6. Century Odd Days \& Repetition** 🔁

- 100 years: 5 odd days
- 200 years: 3 odd days
- 300 years: 1 odd day
- 400 years: 0 odd days (calendar repeats every 400 years)[^2][^3].

---

### **7. Types of Calendar Questions** ❓

- **Finding the Day on a Given Date:** With or without a reference date[^3][^2].
- **Matching Calendars:** Which year/month will have the same calendar as another[^2].
- **Counting Odd Days:** To determine the weekday for a date[^3].
- **Leap Year Calculations:** Identifying leap years and their effect on the calendar[^2].

---

### **8. Tricks \& Shortcuts** 🪄

- The same calendar repeats after 6 or 11 years for ordinary years and after 28 years for leap years[^3].
- The first day of a century is always Monday, Wednesday, Friday, or Saturday[^3].
- Use odd days to quickly find the weekday for any date.

---

## 📝 Quick Practice Question

**Q:** Today is Monday. What day will it be after 61 days?
**Solution:** 61 ÷ 7 = 8 weeks + 5 odd days. Monday + 5 = **Saturday**[^2] 🛍️
