#### Learning Outcomes

1. Know the basics of the rectangular coordinate system and the quadrants.
2. Recognize, show, or plot a point on the coordinate plane.




## 1️⃣ Basics of the Rectangular Coordinate System and Quadrants

The **rectangular coordinate system** (also called the Cartesian coordinate system) uses two number lines that intersect at right angles at a point called the **origin (0,0)**.

- The **horizontal axis** is the \$ x \$-axis.
- The **vertical axis** is the \$ y \$-axis.

These axes divide the plane into **four quadrants**, numbered *counterclockwise* as follows:

- **Quadrant I:** \$ x > 0, y > 0 \$ (top right)
- **Quadrant II:** \$ x < 0, y > 0 \$ (top left)
- **Quadrant III:** \$ x < 0, y < 0 \$ (bottom left)
- **Quadrant IV:** \$ x > 0, y < 0 \$ (bottom right)

- The axes meet at the origin $(0,0)$, and each point in the plane is represented as an ordered pair $(x, y)$.[^1][^5]

## 2️⃣ Recognize, Show, or Plot a Point on the Coordinate Plane

To **plot a point** such as \$ (3, -2) \$:

- Start at the origin $(0,0)$.
- Move 3 units right along the \$ x \$-axis (since \$ x = +3 \$).
- Move 2 units down along the \$ y \$-axis (since \$ y = -2 \$).
- Mark the point here.

**General Rule:**

- The first value in $(x, y)$ is the *horizontal* movement (right if positive, left if negative).
- The second value is the *vertical* movement (up if positive, down if negative).

**Examples:**

- Point \$ (4, 5) \$ lies in Quadrant I (both positive).
- Point \$ (-3, 2) \$ lies in Quadrant II (negative \$ x \$, positive \$ y \$).
- Point \$ (-2, -4) \$ lies in Quadrant III (both negative).
- Point \$ (6, -7) \$ lies in Quadrant IV (positive \$ x \$, negative \$ y \$).

## Exercise Questions 🤯

Hello! On this Wednesday evening here in India, I would be happy to help you with these questions on the rectangular coordinate system. Let's break them down one by one.

{{< border >}}
### **Question 1: Locating Points**

**The Question:**
Choose the correct option with respect to the points $P(5, -3)$, $Q(-3, 3)$, $R(0, -100)$, and $S(-2.5, 0)$ on the rectangular coordinate system.
* Point R does not lie in any quadrant
* Points P and R lie in Quadrant III
* Points S and Q lie in Quadrant II
* Points R and S cannot be represented on the rectangular coordinate system

**Core Concepts: Quadrants and Axes**

To solve this, we need to know where points are located based on the signs of their x and y coordinates.

* **Quadrant I:** x is positive (+), y is positive (+)
* **Quadrant II:** x is negative (-), y is positive (+)
* **Quadrant III:** x is negative (-), y is negative (-)
* **Quadrant IV:** x is positive (+), y is negative (-)
* **On an Axis:** If either the x or y coordinate is 0, the point is not in a quadrant but lies on one of the axes.
    * If x = 0, the point is on the y-axis.
    * If y = 0, the point is on the x-axis.

**Detailed Solution:**

Let's analyze the location of each point:

1.  **P(5, -3):** The x-coordinate (5) is positive, and the y-coordinate (-3) is negative. A (+, -) point lies in **Quadrant IV**.
2.  **Q(-3, 3):** The x-coordinate (-3) is negative, and the y-coordinate (3) is positive. A (-, +) point lies in **Quadrant II**.
3.  **R(0, -100):** The x-coordinate is 0. This means the point lies directly on the **y-axis**. Points on an axis are not in any quadrant.
4.  **S(-2.5, 0):** The y-coordinate is 0. This means the point lies directly on the **x-axis**. Points on an axis are not in any quadrant.

Now let's evaluate the given options:

* **Point R does not lie in any quadrant:** This is **TRUE**. As we determined, R(0, -100) lies on the y-axis.
* **Points P and R lie in Quadrant III:** This is **FALSE**. P is in Quadrant IV, and R is on the y-axis.
* **Points S and Q lie in Quadrant II:** This is **FALSE**. Q is in Quadrant II, but S is on the x-axis.
* **Points R and S cannot be represented on the rectangular coordinate system:** This is **FALSE**. Any ordered pair of real numbers, including those with zero, can be precisely located on the plane.

**Final Answer:** The only correct option is **"Point R does not lie in any quadrant"**.

### **Question 2: Fundamentals of the Coordinate System**

**The Question:**
Which of the following is/are correct with respect to the rectangular coordinate system? (Multiple Select Question)
* The horizontal line is called Y-axis
* The point of intersection of the X and Y axes is called the origin
* The vertical line is called X-axis
* Any point on the coordinate plane can be represented as an ordered pair (x, y)

**Core Concepts: Definitions**

* **x-axis:** The horizontal number line that passes through the origin.
* **y-axis:** The vertical number line that passes through the origin.
* **Origin:** The specific point $(0, 0)$ where the x-axis and y-axis intersect.
* **Ordered Pair:** The standard notation $(x, y)$ that gives the unique "address" of any point by specifying its horizontal distance (x) and vertical distance (y) from the origin.

**Detailed Solution:**

Let's check each statement against the definitions:

1.  **The horizontal line is called Y-axis:** This is **FALSE**. The horizontal line is the x-axis.
2.  **The point of intersection of the X and Y axes is called the origin:** This is **TRUE**. This is the definition of the origin.
3.  **The vertical line is called X-axis:** This is **FALSE**. The vertical line is the y-axis.
4.  **Any point on the coordinate plane can be represented as an ordered pair (x, y):** This is **TRUE**. This is the fundamental purpose of the coordinate system.

**Final Answer:** The two correct statements are **"The point of intersection of the X and Y axes is called the origin"** and **"Any point on the coordinate plane can be represented as an ordered pair (x, y)"**.

### **Question 3: Identifying Incorrect Representations**

**The Question:**
Identify the incorrect options for the representation of a point on the coordinate plane. (Multiple Select Question)

**Core Concepts: Coordinate Conventions**

This question tests the same concepts as Question 1 but asks you to find the mistakes. Let's list the correct conventions first:
* Quadrant I: (+, +)
* Quadrant II: (-, +)
* Quadrant III: (-, -)
* Quadrant IV: (+, -)
* On X-axis: (x, 0) or (±, 0)
* On Y-axis: (0, y) or (0, ±)
* Origin: (0, 0)

**Detailed Solution:**

Now we will evaluate each option to see if it's correct or incorrect. The goal is to identify the **incorrect** ones.

1.  **Quadrant I : (+, +)**: This statement is **CORRECT**.
2.  **Quadrant IV : (-, -)**: This statement is **INCORRECT**. Quadrant IV points have a positive x and a negative y, so the form is (+, -).
3.  **Quadrant II : (-, -)**: This statement is **INCORRECT**. Quadrant II points have a negative x and a positive y, so the form is (-, +).
4.  **Quadrant III : (-, +)**: This statement is **INCORRECT**. Quadrant III points have a negative x and a negative y, so the form is (-, -).
5.  **On X-axis: (0, ±)**: This statement is **INCORRECT**. For any point on the x-axis, the y-coordinate is always 0. The correct form is (±, 0).
6.  **On Y-axis: (±, 0)**: This statement is **INCORRECT**. For any point on the y-axis, the x-coordinate is always 0. The correct form is (0, ±).
7.  **Origin (0,0)**: This statement is **CORRECT**.

**Final Answer:** The incorrect options are:
* Quadrant IV : (-, -)
* Quadrant II : (-, -)
* Quadrant III : (-, +)
* On X-axis: (0, ±)
* On Y-axis: (±, 0)
