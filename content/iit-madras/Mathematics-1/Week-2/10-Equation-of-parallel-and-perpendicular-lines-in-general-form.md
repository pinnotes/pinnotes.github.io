#### Exercise Questions

### 1) Which of the following statements are true?

#### Concepts:

- Two lines $Ax + By + C = 0$ and $A'x + B'y + C' = 0$ are **parallel** if $\frac{A}{B} = \frac{A'}{B'}$.
- They are **perpendicular** if the product of their slopes ($m_1 \cdot m_2$) is $-1$, i.e., $-A/B \cdot -A'/B' = -1 \implies \frac{A}{B} \cdot \frac{A'}{B'} = -1$.


#### Examine Each Option:

- **a) $2x + 3y - 8 = 0$ and $3x - y - 2 = 0$ are parallel?**
    - Slopes:
        - First: $m_1 = -2/3$
        - Second: $m_2 = -3/(-1) = 3$
        - Not equal, so **not parallel**.
- **b) $3x + 5y - 10 = 0$ and $6x + 10y - 26 = 0$ are parallel?**
    - Second equation is just 2 √ó first equation, so slopes are both $-3/5$.
    - **True: They are parallel.**
- **c) $6x + 8y - 20 = 0$ and $4x - 3y = 0$ are perpendicular?**
    - Slopes:
        - First: $m_1 = -6/8 = -3/4$
        - Second: $m_2 = -4/(-3) = 4/3$
        - Product: $(-3/4) \times (4/3) = -1$
        - **True: They are perpendicular.**
- **d) $2x - 3y + 8 = 0$ and $3x + 2y - 18 = 0$ are not perpendicular to each other?**
    - Slopes:
        - First: $m_1 = -2/(-3) = 2/3$
        - Second: $m_2 = -3/2$
        - Product: $(2/3) \times (-3/2) = -1$
        - But option says "are not perpendicular," which is **False** (these are perpendicular).
- **e) $4x + 5y + 10 = 0$ and $10x - 8y - 16 = 0$ are perpendicular?**
    - Slopes:
        - First: $m_1 = -4/5$
        - Second: $m_2 = -10/(-8) = 5/4$
        - Product: $(-4/5) \times (5/4) = -1$
        - **True: They are perpendicular.**

**Correct Statements:**

- **b) Lines $3x+5y-10=0$ and $6x+10y-26=0$ are parallel.**
- **c) Lines $6x+8y-20=0$ and $4x-3y=0$ are perpendicular.**
- **e) Lines $4x+5y+10=0$ and $10x-8y-16=0$ are perpendicular.**

### 2) Given lines $4x + 2ky + 5 = 0$ and $12x + 6y + 15 = 0$ are parallel, find the value of $k$.

#### Concept:

- For two lines $A_1x + B_1y + C_1 = 0$ and $A_2x + B_2y + C_2 = 0$ to be parallel:

$$
\frac{A_1}{B_1} = \frac{A_2}{B_2}
$$
- So,

$$
\frac{4}{2k} = \frac{12}{6} \implies \frac{4}{2k} = 2 \implies 4 = 4k \implies k = 1
$$

**Final Answer:**
$\boxed{1}$

#### **Concept Recap:**

- **Parallel lines** have equal slopes ($-A/B$ same for both).
- **Perpendicular lines** have slopes whose product is $-1$: $m_1 m_2 = -1$.
- To find **k** for parallel lines, set slope ratios equal and solve for k.
