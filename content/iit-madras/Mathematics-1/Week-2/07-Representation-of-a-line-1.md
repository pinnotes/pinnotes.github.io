#### Learning Outcomes

1. Obtain equations of horizontal and vertical lines on the coordinate plane.
2. Find the equation of a line in point-slope form and two-points form.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Equations of Horizontal and Vertical Lines

- **Horizontal Lines:**
These lines run parallel to the $x$-axis. All points on a horizontal line have the same $y$-coordinate.

**Equation:**

$$
y = c
$$

where \$ c \$ is a constant representing the $y$-value for every point on the line.

**Example:** \$ y = 3 \$ represents a horizontal line passing through all points with \$ y = 3 \$.
- **Vertical Lines:**
These lines run parallel to the $y$-axis. All points on a vertical line have the same $x$-coordinate.

**Equation:**

$$
x = k
$$

where \$ k \$ is a constant representing the $x$-value for every point on the line.

**Example:** \$ x = -2 \$ is a vertical line passing through all points with \$ x = -2 \$.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Find Equation of a Line in Point-Slope Form and Two-Points Form

- **Point-Slope Form**
Given a point \$ (x_1, y_1) \$ on the line and the slope \$ m \$, the equation is:

$$
y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)
$$

This form directly relates any point on the line to slope and a reference point.

***

- **Two-Points Form**
Given two points \$ (x_1, y_1) \$ and \$ (x_2, y_2) \$, the slope is:

$$
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
$$

Then the line's equation can be written as:

$$
\frac{y - y_1}{x - x_1} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
$$

These forms allow flexible calculation and graphing of linear equations.


## Exercise Questions ü§Ø

Hello! On this Wednesday evening here in India, I would be happy to explain these questions about the equations of lines. This is a key area of coordinate geometry.

### **Question 1: Equation of a Horizontal Line** (from file `image_0e0a21.png`)

**The Question:**
Which of the following represents an equation of the horizontal line?
* $y = 0$
* $x = 5$
* $x = -2$
* $x = 0$

**Core Concept: Equations of Horizontal and Vertical Lines**

* **Horizontal Line:** A line that runs perfectly flat, parallel to the x-axis. Every single point on this line has the **same y-coordinate**. Therefore, its equation is always in the form **$y = c$**, where 'c' is that constant y-value.
* **Vertical Line:** A line that runs straight up and down, parallel to the y-axis. Every point on this line has the **same x-coordinate**. Its equation is always in the form **$x = c$**.

**Detailed Solution:**

Let's look at the options:
* **$y = 0$**: This equation states that the y-coordinate is always 0, regardless of the x-value. This is the definition of a horizontal line (it's the x-axis itself).
* **$x = 5$**: This is an equation for a vertical line where the x-coordinate is always 5.
* **$x = -2$**: This is an equation for a vertical line where the x-coordinate is always -2.
* **$x = 0$**: This is an equation for a vertical line where the x-coordinate is always 0 (it's the y-axis itself).

**Final Answer:** **$y = 0$** represents a horizontal line.

### **Question 2: Equation of a Line Parallel to the X-axis** (from file `image_0e0a21.png`)

**The Question:**
The equation of a line parallel to the X-axis and passing through the point $(-2, 0)$ is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
* $y=0$
* $x=0$
* $x=-2$
* $y=-2$

**Core Concept: Finding the Equation of a Specific Horizontal Line**

1.  A line parallel to the X-axis is a horizontal line.
2.  Its equation must be in the form $y = c$.
3.  If the line passes through a specific point $(a, b)$, then the y-coordinate of that point gives us the value of $c$. So, the equation must be $y = b$.

**Detailed Solution:**

1.  The line is "parallel to the X-axis," which means it is a horizontal line. Its equation must be $y = c$.
2.  The line "passes through the point $(-2, 0)$".
3.  This means that for our line, the y-value must be the same as the y-coordinate of this point. The y-coordinate is 0.
4.  Therefore, the constant $c$ is 0, and the equation of the line is $y = 0$.

**Final Answer:** The equation is **$y=0$**.

### **Question 3: Equation from Origin and Slope** (from file `image_0e0a21.png`)

**The Question:**
The equation of a line passing through the origin and with slope -1 is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
* $y=x$
* $y=-x+1$
* $y=-x$
* $y=-x-1$

**Core Concept: Slope-Intercept Form**

A very useful form for the equation of a line is the slope-intercept form:
$$y = mx + c$$
where $m$ is the **slope** and $c$ is the **y-intercept** (the point where the line crosses the y-axis).

**Detailed Solution:**

1.  **Identify the slope:** We are given that the slope $m = -1$.
2.  **Identify the y-intercept:** The line passes through the origin, which is the point $(0, 0)$. The y-intercept is the y-value when x is 0, so the y-intercept $c = 0$.
3.  **Substitute into the slope-intercept form:**
    * $y = mx + c$
    * $y = (-1)x + 0$
4.  **Simplify the equation:**
    * $y = -x$

**Final Answer:** The equation is **$y = -x$**.

### **Question 4: Equation from Two Points** (from both images)

**The Question:**
The equation of a line passing through the origin and $(-1, -3)$ is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
* $y=3x$
* $y=-3x+3$
* $y=-3x$
* $y = -x/3$

**Core Concept: Finding the Equation from Two Points**

This is a two-step process:
1.  **Find the slope ($m$)** using the slope formula: $m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$.
2.  **Use the slope and one point** in the slope-intercept form ($y = mx + c$) to find the equation.

**Detailed Solution:**

1.  **Step 1: Find the slope.**
    * Our two points are $(x_1, y_1) = (0, 0)$ and $(x_2, y_2) = (-1, -3)$.
    * $m = \frac{-3 - 0}{-1 - 0} = \frac{-3}{-1} = 3$.

2.  **Step 2: Find the equation.**
    * We know the slope $m = 3$.
    * Since the line passes through the origin $(0, 0)$, the y-intercept $c = 0$.
    * Substitute into the slope-intercept form $y = mx + c$:
    * $y = (3)x + 0$
    * $y = 3x$

**Final Answer:** The equation of the line is **$y = 3x$**.

* Point (0, 0) can lie on a horizontal line.
* The equation of a horizontal line can be $x = a$.
* Points lying on a horizontal line are of the form $(x, a)$.

**Core Concept: Properties of a Horizontal Line**

A horizontal line has a constant y-value and a slope of 0. It is parallel to the x-axis and perpendicular to the y-axis.

**Detailed Solution:**

1.  **"It is parallel to the Y-axis."**: **FALSE**. It is perpendicular to the Y-axis.
2.  **"Point (0, 0) can lie on a horizontal line."**: **TRUE**. The x-axis itself is a horizontal line with the equation $y=0$, and it passes through the origin (0, 0).
3.  **"The equation of a horizontal line can be $x = a$."**: **FALSE**. $x=a$ is the equation for a vertical line. A horizontal line is $y=a$.
4.  **"Points lying on a horizontal line are of the form $(x, a)$."**: **TRUE**. This means that for any x-value, the y-value is always the same constant, 'a'. This is the definition of a horizontal line.

**Final Answer:** The correct statements are **"Point (0, 0) can lie on a horizontal line"** and **"Points lying on a horizontal line are of the form (x, a)"**.

### **Question 7: Forms of Linear Equations** (from file `image_0e073c.png`)

**The Question:**
Choose the correct option. (Multiple Select Question)
* The equation of a line in point slope form and two point form can both be converted to $y = mx + c$ form.
* $(y - y_0) = m(x - x_0)$ is a two point form of equation of line
* The equation of a horizontal line can be $x=a$
* $(y - y_1) = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}(x - x_1)$ is a two point form of the equation of a line

**Core Concepts: Different Forms of Linear Equations**

* **Slope-Intercept Form:** $y = mx + c$ (Given slope and y-intercept).
* **Point-Slope Form:** $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$ (Given a point and the slope).
* **Two-Point Form:** $y - y_1 = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}(x - x_1)$ (Given two points). Notice that the fraction part is just the slope formula, so this is really just an extension of the point-slope form.

**Detailed Solution:**

1.  **"The equation of a line in point slope form and two point form can both be converted to $y = mx + c$ form."**: **TRUE**. By distributing and isolating y, both of these forms can be simplified into the slope-intercept form.
2.  **"$(y - y_0) = m(x - x_0)$ is a two point form of equation of line"**: **FALSE**. This is the standard definition of the **point-slope form**.
3.  **"The equation of a horizontal line can be $x=a$"**: **FALSE**. This is the equation for a vertical line.
4.  **"$(y - y_1) = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}(x - x_1)$ is a two point form of the equation of a line"**: **TRUE**. This is the standard definition of the two-point form.

**Final Answer:** The correct options are **"The equation of a line in point slope form and two point form can both be converted to y = mx + c form"** and **"$(y - y_1) = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}(x - x_1)$ is a two point form of the equation of a line"**.
