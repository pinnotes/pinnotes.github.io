## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Compute the Cartesian Product of Two Non-Empty Sets

- **Definition:** The Cartesian Product \$ A \times B \$ of sets \$ A \$ and \$ B \$ is the set of all ordered pairs $(a, b)$ such that $a \in A$ and $b \in B$.

$$
A \times B = \{ (a, b) \mid a \in A, b \in B \}
$$

- Example:
\$ A = \{1, 2\}, B = \{x, y\} \$
Then:

$$
A \times B = \{(1,x), (1,y), (2,x), (2,y)\}
$$

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Identify Relations as a Subset of the Cartesian Product

- A **Relation** \$ R \$ from set \$ A \$ to \$ B \$ is a subset of the Cartesian product \$ A \times B \$.

$$
R \subseteq A \times B
$$

- Each related pair \$ (a, b) \in R \$.
- Example:
\$ A = \{1,2\}, B = \{x,y\} \$
Relation \$ R = \{ (1,x), (2,y) \} \subseteq A \times B \$.
- Relations express connections or associations between elements of \$ A \$ and \$ B \$.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Properties of Relations: Reflexive, Symmetric, Transitive, Antisymmetric

- **Reflexive:**
For every $a \in A$, $(a, a) \in R$.
Example: Equality relation.
- **Symmetric:**
If $(a, b) \in R$, then $(b, a) \in R$.
Example: "Is sibling of" relation.
- **Transitive:**
If $(a, b) \in R$ and $(b, c) \in R$, then $(a, c) \in R$.
Example: "Is ancestor of" relation.
- **Antisymmetric:**
If $(a, b) \in R$ and $(b, a) \in R$, then $a = b$.
Example: "Less than or equal to" ($\leq$).

### Examples for each:

| Property | Example Relation | Explanation |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Reflexive | Equality $=$ | Every element equal to itself |
| Symmetric | Friendship | If A is friend of B, B is friend of A |
| Transitive | "Ancestor of" | If A is ancestor of B and B of C, then A of C |
| Antisymmetric | ‚â§ relation on numbers | If $a ‚â§ b$ and $b ‚â§ a$, then $a = b$ |

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Define Equivalence Relation and Equivalence Classes

- **Equivalence Relation:** A relation $R$ on a set $A$ that is **reflexive, symmetric, and transitive**.
- **Equivalence Class:** For $a \in A$, the equivalence class $[a]$ is:

$$
[a] = \{x \in A \mid (a, x) \in R\}
$$

All elements related to $a$ form the class.

***

### Examples of Equivalence Relations:

1. **Equality ($=$)**: every element equal to itself satisfies all properties.
2. **Congruence modulo $n$:**

$$
a \equiv b \pmod{n}
$$

3. **Similarity of triangles:** Two triangles are related if they are similar.
4. **Parallelism of lines:** Lines related if parallel.
5. **Same birthdate:** People with same birthdate are related.

## Exercise Questions üêª‚Äç‚ùÑÔ∏è


{{< border >}}

### 1) Let $A = \{1,4\}$ and $B = \{2,4,6,8\}$. Which of the following is the Cartesian product of $A$ and $B$?

#### **Detailed Answer:**

By definition,

$$
A \times B = \{(a, b)\ |\ a \in A, b \in B\}
$$

So:

- $(1,2), (1,4), (1,6), (1,8), (4,2), (4,4), (4,6), (4,8)$

**Correct Option:**
$\{(1,2), (1,4), (1,6), (1,8), (4,2), (4,4), (4,6), (4,8)\}$

### 2) If set \$ M \$ contains 4 elements and set \$ N \$ contains 3 elements, then \$ M \times N \$ contains \$ x \$ elements. What is the value of \$ x \$?

#### **Detailed Answer:**

Number of elements in \$ M \times N \$ is \$ 4 \times 3 = 12 \$.

**Correct Answer:** \$ x = 12 \$

### 3) Suppose the Cartesian product $A \times B$ has 18 elements. Which of the following options may represent the number of elements in $A$ and $B$?

#### **Detailed Answer:**

If $|A| \times |B| = 18$. Possible factorizations:

- \$ 3 \times 6 = 18 \$
- \$ 6 \times 3 = 18 \$
- \$ 2 \times 9 = 18 \$
- \$ 9 \times 2 = 18 \$

All these pairs are present in options.

**Correct Answer:** All valid pairs:

- 3, 9
- 2, 9
- 9, 9 (Incorrect because 9‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ9‚Äâ=‚Äâ81, not 18)
- 6, 3

So, A, B, D.

### 4) Which of the following statement(s) is(are) true?

- In a set, order of elements is not important.
- A relation is a subset of Cartesian product.
- In each pair of Cartesian product, order is not important.
- All of the above


#### **Detailed Answer:**

- Order in a set is not important: **True**
- A relation is a subset of a Cartesian product: **True**
- In each pair of Cartesian product, order **is important** (so option 3 is **false**).
- Therefore, "All of the above" is **not true**.

**Correct Answer:** The first two statements only.

### 5) Let $B = \{\text{Anil}, \text{Ramu}, \text{Suraj}\}$ and $G = \{\text{Neha}, \text{Keerthi}\}$ be the sets of boys and girls, respectively. Ramu is brother of Neha, Anil is brother of Keerthi, Suraj is brother of Neha and Keerthi. Relation $R$ is: \$ R = \{(a, b) \mid (a, b) \in B \times G, a is brother of b\} \$.

#### **Detailed Answer:**

Map brothers to girls:

- Ramu is brother of Neha: (Ramu, Neha)
- Anil is brother of Keerthi: (Anil, Keerthi)
- Suraj is brother of Neha and Keerthi: (Suraj, Neha), (Suraj, Keerthi)

So $R$ = \{(Anil, Keerthi), (Ramu, Neha), (Suraj, Neha), (Suraj, Keerthi)\}

**Correct Option:**
$\{(Anil, Keerthi), (Ramu, Neha), (Suraj, Neha), (Suraj, Keerthi)\}$

### 6) Let $S$ be a set of students who are studying B.Tech first year at I.I.T Madras. Which of the following relations is a symmetric relation?

#### **Detailed Answer:**

- ‚ÄúYounger than‚Äù or ‚Äúgot more marks‚Äù: Not symmetric.
- ‚ÄúClassmate of‚Äù: If $a$ is classmate of $b$, $b$ is classmate of $a$ (**symmetric**).
- ‚ÄúTaller than‚Äù: Not symmetric.

**Correct Answer:**
$\{(a, b) \mid a, b \in S, a \text{ is classmate of } b\}$

### 7) Which of the following statement(s) is(are) incorrect?

- An equivalence relation partitions a set.
- An equivalence class is same as equivalence relation.
- Antisymmetric relation is an equivalence relation.
- Elements in Cartesian product will only be in pairs.


#### **Detailed Answer:**

- An equivalence relation partitions a set: **True**
- Equivalence class is not the same as equivalence relation: **Incorrect**
- Antisymmetric relation is not an equivalence relation: **Incorrect**
- Elements in Cartesian product are always ordered pairs: **True**

**Correct Answers:**

- "An equivalence class is same as equivalence relation."
- "Antisymmetric relation is an equivalence relation."
