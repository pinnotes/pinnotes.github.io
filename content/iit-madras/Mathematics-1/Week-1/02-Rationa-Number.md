## üßÆ Define Rational Numbers

A **rational number** is any number that can be written as a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are integers and $q \neq 0$.[^1][^2][^3]

- Examples: $\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{3}{4}, 2, 0.3$ (which is $\frac{3}{10}$), and $-5$ (which is $\frac{-5}{1}$).[^2][^4]
- All integers and whole numbers are rational since they can be written as fractions too.[^4][^5]
- Denoted by the set $\mathbb{Q}$.[^1]

[^1]

## üìä Order and Compare Rational Numbers

To **compare rational numbers**, write them as decimals or with a common denominator.

- Example: Compare $\frac{2}{3}$ and $\frac{3}{5}$:
    - $\frac{2}{3} = 0.666...$
    - $\frac{3}{5} = 0.6$
    - $0.666... > 0.6$ so $\frac{2}{3} > \frac{3}{5}$.[^6][^7]
- When ordering a list, convert all to decimals or use common denominators.

[^6]

## üèÜ Find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)

The **GCD** (greatest common divisor) of two numbers is the largest number that divides both exactly.

- Example: GCD of 12 and 26:
    - Factors of 12: $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12$
    - Factors of 26: $1, 2, 13, 26$
    - Common factors: $1, 2$
    - Greatest: **2**[^8][^9][^10]

- Visual method: List factors or use the Euclidean algorithm (keep dividing and taking remainders).

[^8]

## üåà Rational Numbers Are Dense on the Number Line

**Density** means between any two rational numbers, there‚Äôs always another rational number!

- Example: Between $\frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{3}{4}$, the average $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{3}{4}/2 = \frac{5}{8}$ is in between.
- No matter how close two rational numbers are, you can ALWAYS find another rational number between them.[^11][^12][^13]
- On the number line, rational numbers fill it densely and continuously.

## Exercise Questions ü§Ø


{{< border >}}

## 1. Which of the following option(s) is (are) true?

A) \$ \frac{4}{7} > \frac{5}{8} \$

B) \$ \frac{17}{22} > \frac{13}{18} \$

C) \$ \frac{11}{7} > \frac{13}{8} \$

D) \$ \frac{7}{15} < \frac{5}{20} \$

### **Detailed Solution:**

**A) \$ \frac{4}{7} > \frac{5}{8} \$**

Find a common denominator:

$4/7 = 32/56$, $5/8 = 35/56$

$32/56 < 35/56$

So, $4/7 < 5/8$. **Not true.**

- **B) \$ \frac{17}{22} > \frac{13}{18} \$**

Find a common denominator:

$17/22 = (17 \times 18) / (22 \times 18) = 306/396$

$13/18 = (13 \times 22) / (18 \times 22) = 286/396$

$306/396 > 286/396$

So, $17/22 > 13/18$. **True.**

- **C) \$ \frac{11}{7} > \frac{13}{8} \$**
- 
Convert to improper fractions with common denominators:

$11/7 = (11 \times 8)/(7 \times 8) = 88/56$

$13/8 = (13 \times 7)/(8 \times 7) = 91/56$

$88/56 < 91/56$

So, $11/7 < 13/8$. **Not true.**

- **D) \$ \frac{7}{15} < \frac{5}{20} \$**
- 
$7/15 \approx 0.4667$, $5/20 = 0.25$

$0.4667 > 0.25$

So, $7/15 > 5/20$. **Not true.**

**Correct Answer:** Only option **B** is true.

## 2. Which of the following option(s) is (are) in reduced form?

A) \$ \frac{5}{60} \$
B) \$ \frac{12}{27} \$
C) \$ \frac{11}{18} \$
D) \$ \frac{13}{91} \$

### **Detailed Solution:**

- **A) \$ \frac{5}{60} \$:** Both numerator and denominator divisible by 5. $5/60 = 1/12$. **Not reduced.**
- **B) \$ \frac{12}{27} \$:** Both divisible by 3. $12/27 = 4/9$. **Not reduced.**
- **C) \$ \frac{11}{18} \$:** 11 and 18 have no common factors other than 1. **This is reduced form.**
- **D) \$ \frac{13}{91} \$:** 91 = 7 √ó 13. Both divisible by 13. $13/91 = 1/7$. **Not reduced.**

**Correct Answer:** Only **C** is in reduced form.

## 3. Let gcd(a,4) = 2 and gcd(a, b) = 1. If 4 > a > b and a, b are natural numbers, then the values of a and b are respectively

A) 2, 1
B) 1, 2
C) 2, 4
D) 4, 2

### **Detailed Solution:**

- $gcd(a,4) = 2$: $a$ must be even but not divisible by 4. Since $a < 4$, possible $a$ is 2.
- $gcd(a,b) = 1$: $a$ and $b$ are coprime.
- Since $a = 2$ and $a > b$, try $b=1$:
$gcd(2,1) = 1$ ‚úì

Hence, values are $a=2$, $b=1$.

**Correct Answer:** A) 2, 1

### **Summary Table**

| Qn | Correct Option | Explanation |
| :-- | :--: | :-- |
| 1 | B | $17/22 > 13/18$ is true; others are false. |
| 2 | C | $11/18$ is the only fraction in reduced form. |
| 3 | A | Only $a = 2, b = 1$ fit all GCD and ordering conditions. |
