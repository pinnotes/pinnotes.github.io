A well-defined collection of distinct objects called elements or members.

{{< youtube Ue3y-OE_2lE >}}

#### Learning Outcomes:

1. Write a set in its comprehensive form called set comprehension.
2. Construct different subsets from a given set.
3. Distinguish between closed interval and open interval.
4. Demonstrate the ability to perform operations like union, intersection, set difference, and complement on sets using proper notation.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Set Comprehension: Writing Sets in Comprehensive Form

- **Set comprehension** is a way to define a set by describing the properties its members must satisfy instead of listing elements.
- **Notation:**

$$
A = \{x \mid \text{property of } x\}
$$

Reads as: "Set \$ A \$ is the set of all \$ x \$ such that \$ x \$ satisfies the property."
- **Example:**
Set of all even integers:

$$
E = \{x \mid x \in \mathbb{Z} \text{ and } x \text{ is even}\}
$$

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Constructing Subsets from a Given Set

- Given a set \$ S = \{a, b, c\} \$, subsets are any sets containing zero or more elements of \$ S \$.
- **All subsets of \$ S \$:**

$$
\{\emptyset, \{a\}, \{b\}, \{c\}, \{a,b\}, \{a,c\}, \{b,c\}, \{a,b,c\}\}
$$

- Visualized as a **power set** containing $2^n$ subsets for a set of $n$ elements.
- **Diagram:**

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Distinguish Between Closed Interval and Open Interval

- **Closed Interval $[a,b]$:** Includes endpoints $a$ and $b$.

$$
[a, b] = \{x | a \leq x \leq b\}
$$
- **Open Interval $(a,b)$:** Excludes endpoints $a$ and $b$.

$$
(a, b) = \{x | a < x < b\}
$$
- **Diagram:**

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Set Operations: Union, Intersection, Set Difference, Complement

![A graph illustrating set operations](https://articles.outlier.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkj4bmrik9d6o%2F4QKb5k8Z4WCl2VWZ1b8Hh6%2F7402b6476f15131a7408ac7ac9e3bf45%2FOutlier_Graph_SetOperations-02.png&w=3840&q=75)

- **Union ( \$ A \cup B \$ ):** All elements in \$ A \$ or \$ B \$ or both.
Example: \$ A = \{1,2\}, B = \{2,3\} \Rightarrow A \cup B = \{1,2,3\} \$
- **Intersection ( \$ A \cap B \$ ):** Elements common to both \$ A \$ and \$ B \$.
Example: \$ A \cap B = \{2\} \$
- **Set Difference ( \$ A - B \$ ):** Elements in \$ A \$ but not in \$ B \$.
Example: \$ A - B = \{1\} \$
- **Complement ( \$ A^c \$ or \$ \bar{A} \$ ):** Elements not in \$ A \$ relative to the universal set \$ U \$.

### 1) Which of the following is a correct representation of set comprehension?

A) \$ \{x \mid x \in \mathbb{N}, x is even\} \$
B) \$ \{x \in \mathbb{Z}, x is even\} \$
C) \$ x is even, x \in \mathbb{N}, x \} \$
D) \$ x is even, x \in \mathbb{Z}, x \} \$

#### **Detailed Answer:**

Proper set comprehension involves curly brackets and a "such that" ($\mid$ or ":") description.
A) is correct as it uses the proper notation:

$$
\{x \mid x \in \mathbb{N}, x \text{ is even}\}
$$

B is missing the surrounding curly brackets and "such that".
C and D are not valid set notations.

**Correct Answer:** A

### 2) Which of the following is the set of natural numbers that are multiples of 3 or 5?

A) \$ \{x \mid x \in \mathbb{N}, x \bmod 3 = 0 and x \bmod 5 = 0\} \$
B) \$ \{x \mid x \in \mathbb{N}, x \bmod 3 = 0 or x \bmod 5 = 0\} \$
C) \$ \{x \mid x \in \mathbb{N}, x \bmod 3 = 0 and x \bmod 5 = 0\} \$
D) \$ \{x \mid x \in \mathbb{N}, x \bmod 3 = 0 or x \bmod 5 = 0\} \$

#### **Detailed Answer:**

Multiples of 3 or 5 are numbers divisible by either 3 or 5.
So, "or" is appropriate, not "and".
B) and D) are identical and correct.

**Correct Answer:** B or D
