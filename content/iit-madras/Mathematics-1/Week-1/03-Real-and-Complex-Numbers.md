Real Numbers (R) include all rational numbers plus all irrational numbers (numbers that cannot be expressed as fractions). This makes the real numbers a complete set covering every possible point on the number line.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ How Rational Numbers Extend to Real Numbers

- **Rational Numbers** ($\mathbb{Q}$) are numbers expressed as fractions $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p, q$ are integers, $q \neq 0$. Examples: $\frac{1}{2}, 0.75, -3$.[^1][^2]
- **Real Numbers** ($\mathbb{R}$) include all rational numbers **plus** all irrational numbers (numbers that cannot be expressed as fractions). This makes the real numbers a complete set covering every possible point on the number line.[^3]

üìè Visualization: Real numbers include both rational and irrational, filling the number line without gaps.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Identify Irrational Numbers and Complex Numbers

- **Irrational Numbers** are real numbers that **cannot** be written as a simple fraction $\frac{p}{q}$. Their decimals are **non-terminating and non-repeating**.
Examples: $\pi$, $\sqrt{2}$, $e$.[^4]
- **Complex Numbers** combine real and imaginary parts, written as $a + bi$, where $i = \sqrt{-1}$.[^5][^6]
Example: $3 + 4i$, where 3 is the real part and 4i is the imaginary part.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Classify a Real Number as Integer, Rational, or Irrational

- **Classification:**

| Number Type | Description | Examples |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Integer ($\mathbb{Z}$) | Whole numbers including negatives, zero, positives | $-3, 0, 7$ |
| Rational ($\mathbb{Q}$) | Can be written as fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ | $\frac{1}{2}, -4, 0.75$ |
| Irrational | Cannot be expressed as fraction; decimals non-terminating/non-repeating | $\pi, \sqrt{2}$ |

üî¢ All integers are rational, all rationals and irrationals together form real numbers.

## Exercise Questions ü§Ø

{{< border >}}

### 1) Which of the following statement(s) is(are) false?

- The sum of two natural numbers is always a natural number.
- The difference between two integers is always an integer.
- The product of two rational numbers is always a real number.
- The product of two irrational numbers is always an irrational number.


#### **Detailed Answer:**

- **The sum of two natural numbers is always a natural number:**
True. Example: \$ 7 + 5 = 12 \$ (still a natural number).
- **The difference between two integers is always an integer:**
True. Example: \$ -3 - 7 = -10 \$ (still an integer).
- **The product of two rational numbers is always a real number:**
True. All rational numbers are real numbers, so their product is always a real number.
- **The product of two irrational numbers is always an irrational number:**
**False!** Example: \$ \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{2} = 2 \$ (which is rational). Sometimes the product can be rational.

**Correct Answer:**
The **fourth statement** is false:
*The product of two irrational numbers is always an irrational number.*

### 2) How many irrational numbers are there in the given list?

**Given list:**
$\sqrt{3},\ 2.5, \sqrt{49},\ \frac{17}{2},\ 22, \pi, -35, \sqrt{6}, 1729, -20000$

#### **Detailed Answer:**

**Irrational numbers** are real numbers that cannot be expressed as a simple fraction.

- $\sqrt{3}$: Irrational (not a perfect square, non-repeating, non-terminating decimal)
- $2.5$: Rational ($5/2$)
- $\sqrt{49}$: $= 7$, rational
- $\frac{17}{2}$: Rational
- $22$: Rational
- $\pi$: Irrational (never-ending, non-repeating decimal)
- $-35$: Rational (integer)
- $\sqrt{6}$: Irrational (not a perfect square)
- $1729$: Rational (integer)
- $-20000$: Rational (integer)

**So, the irrational numbers are:**
$\sqrt{3}, \pi, \sqrt{6}$

**Count:** 3

**Correct Answer:** 3 irrational numbers in the list.

### 3) How many integers are there in the given list?

**Given list:**
$\sqrt{3},\ 2.5, \sqrt{49},\ \frac{17}{2},\ 22, \pi, -35, \sqrt{6}, 1729, -20000$

#### **Detailed Answer:**

**Integers** are whole numbers, positive, negative, or zero (without fractional/decimal part):

- $\sqrt{3}$: Not an integer.
- $2.5$: Not an integer.
- $\sqrt{49} = 7$: Integer.
- $\frac{17}{2}=8.5$: Not an integer.
- $22$: Integer.
- $\pi$: Not an integer.
- $-35$: Integer.
- $\sqrt{6}$: Not an integer.
- $1729$: Integer.
- $-20000$: Integer.

**So, the integers are:**
$\sqrt{49} (=7),\ 22,\ -35,\ 1729,\ -20000$

**Count:** 5

**Correct Answer:** 5 integers in the list.

### 4) Which of the following statement(s) is(are) true?

- \$ \sqrt{2} \$ is a complex number.
- Real numbers extend rational numbers.
- None of these.


#### **Detailed Answer:**

- \$ \sqrt{2} \$ is a real and irrational number, which is also technically a special case of a complex number (since all real numbers are complex of the form $a + 0i$), but usually when we say "complex number," we refer to numbers with a nonzero imaginary part.
- Real numbers extend (include) all rational numbers, so this is **true** (every rational is real, but not every real is rational).
- "None of these" is incorrect because one correct statement is present.

**Correct Answer:**
**Real numbers extend rational numbers.**

### 5) Which of the following rational numbers are greater than \$ \sqrt{2} \$ and less than \$ \sqrt{3} \$?

Options:

- \$ \frac{9}{5} \$
- \$ \frac{3}{2} \$
- \$ \frac{5}{3} \$
- \$ \frac{17}{10} \$


#### **Detailed Answer:**

First, find decimal values for comparison:

- \$ \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414 \$
- \$ \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \$

Convert each option to decimal:

- \$ \frac{9}{5} = 1.8 \$
- \$ \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \$
- \$ \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.6667 \$
- \$ \frac{17}{10} = 1.7 \$

Now, select values \$ x \$ such that \$ \sqrt{2} < x < \sqrt{3} \$ (i.e., \$ 1.414 < x < 1.732 \$):

- \$ \frac{9}{5} = 1.8 \$: Not in the range.
- \$ \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \$: In the range.
- \$ \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.6667 \$: In the range.
- \$ \frac{17}{10} = 1.7 \$: In the range.

**Correct answers:**
\$ \frac{3}{2}, \frac{5}{3}, \frac{17}{10} \$ are greater than \$ \sqrt{2} \$ and less than \$ \sqrt{3} \$.
