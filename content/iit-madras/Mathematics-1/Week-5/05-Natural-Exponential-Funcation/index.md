Good evening! Here in India on this Sunday, let's explore these questions. They are great examples of how exponential functions, especially those using the natural number $e$, model real-world phenomena like finance, population changes, and even concepts in calculus.

### **Core Concepts: The Exponential Function and the Number 'e'**

1.  **Exponential Growth/Decay:** Many real-world processes are modeled by these functions:
    * **Annual Growth (like interest):** $S = a(1 + r)^n$, where '$a$' is the initial amount, '$r$' is the growth rate per period, and '$n$' is the number of periods.
    * **Continuous Growth/Decay (like populations):** $F(t) = ae^{kt}$, where '$a$' is the initial amount, '$t$' is time, and '$k$' is the growth/decay constant. If $k$ is positive, it's growth; if $k$ is negative, it's decay.

2.  **The Natural Number $e$:**
    * $e$ is a special irrational number, approximately equal to **2.71828**.
    * It is defined by the limit: $e = \lim_{n\to\infty} \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^n$.
    * **In Calculus:** The function $f(x) = e^x$ is its own derivative, meaning the slope of the curve at any point $x$ is also $e^x$.

3.  **The Natural Logarithm ($\ln$):**
    * The natural logarithm is the inverse of the exponential function $e^x$. It is used to solve for a variable in an exponent: if $y = e^x$, then $\ln(y) = x$.

### **Question 1: Stock Price Growth** (from file `image_c6353c.png`)

**The Question:**
Suppose that a stock's price continues to increase at the rate of 5 % per year. If the value of one share of this stock is â‚¹1000 at present, then find the value(in â‚¹) of one share of this stock two years from now. (Use the formula $S = a(1+r)^n$)

**Detailed Solution:**

1.  **Identify the variables** from the problem and the formula $S = a(1+r)^n$:
    * Initial value (present value), $a = 1000$.
    * Increase rate per year, $r = 5\% = 0.05$.
    * Number of years, $n = 2$.
    * Final value, $S$, is what we need to find.
2.  **Substitute the values into the formula:**
    $$S = 1000(1 + 0.05)^2$$
3.  **Calculate the result:**
    $$S = 1000(1.05)^2$$$$S = 1000(1.1025)$$$$S = 1102.5$$

**Final Answer:** The value of one share two years from now will be **â‚¹1102.5**.

### **Question 2: Which of the following options yield the value 'e'?** (from file `image_c6322d.png`)

**The Question:**
Which of the following options yield the value 'e'? (Multiple Select Question)

**Detailed Solution:**

Let's analyze each option based on the properties of $e$.

* **"The slope of the tangent line of the curve $f(x) = e^x$ at x = 1"**
    * A unique property of the function $f(x)=e^x$ is that its derivative (which gives the slope of the tangent line) is also $e^x$.
    * So, the slope at any point $x$ is $f'(x) = e^x$.
    * At $x=1$, the slope is $f'(1) = e^1 = e$. This statement is **TRUE**.

* **"The slope of the tangent line of the curve $f(x) = x^2 + ex$ at x = 1"**
    * The derivative is $f'(x) = 2x + e$.
    * At $x=1$, the slope is $f'(1) = 2(1) + e = 2+e$. This is not $e$. This statement is **FALSE**.

* **"The area under the curve $f(x) = 2e^x$, from $(-\infty, 1)$"**
    * This requires integration: $\int_{-\infty}^{1} 2e^x \,dx = [2e^x]_{-\infty}^{1} = 2e^1 - \lim_{a \to -\infty} 2e^a = 2e - 0 = 2e$. This is not $e$. This statement is **FALSE**.

* **"The area under the curve $f(x) = e^x$ from $(-\infty, 1)$"**
    * This requires integration: $\int_{-\infty}^{1} e^x \,dx = [e^x]_{-\infty}^{1} = e^1 - \lim_{a \to -\infty} e^a = e - 0 = e$. This statement is **TRUE**.

**Final Answer:**
* **The slope of the tangent line of the curve $f(x) = e^x$ at x = 1**
* **The area under the curve $f(x) = e^x$ from $(-\infty, 1)$**

### **Question 3: Correct Statements about 'e'** (from file `image_c6322d.png`)

**The Question:**
Which of the following statements is(are) CORRECT?

**Detailed Solution:**

* **"If $n \to \infty$, then $(1+\frac{1}{n})^n \to \infty$"**: **FALSE**. This is the famous limit that defines the number $e$. It does not go to infinity.
* **"If $n \to \infty$, then $(1+\frac{1}{n})^n \to e$"**: **TRUE**. This is the formal definition of the natural number $e$.
* **"Every $f(x) = a^x, a < 1$ has same properties as $g(x) = e^x$"**: **FALSE**. The base $e \approx 2.718$, which is greater than 1, so $g(x)=e^x$ is an increasing (growth) function. For $0<a<1$, $f(x)=a^x$ is a decreasing (decay) function. They have opposite properties.
* **"Every $f(x) = a^x, a > 1$ has same properties as $g(x) = e^x$"**: **TRUE**. Since $e > 1$, $g(x)=e^x$ is an exponential growth function. Any function $f(x)=a^x$ where the base $a$ is also greater than 1 will have the same fundamental properties (it will be increasing, have a domain of $\mathbb{R}$, a range of $(0, \infty)$, etc.).

**Final Answer:** The correct statements are:
* **If $n \to \infty$, then $(1+\frac{1}{n})^n \to e$**
* **Every $f(x) = a^x, a > 1$ has same properties as $g(x) = e^x$**

### **Question 4: Blue Whale Population (Future Prediction)** (from file `image_c6322d.png`)

**The Question:**
In 1990, the population of blue whales in the world is approximately 3200. Let $F(t)$ be the approximate population... after $t$ years since 1990, defined as $F(t) = 3200e^{-0.15t}$. What is the approximate population of blue whales in the world in the year 2020?

**Detailed Solution:**

1.  **Find the value of $t$:** The model starts in 1990 ($t=0$). We need to find the population in 2020.
    * $t = 2020 - 1990 = 30$ years.
2.  **Substitute $t=30$ into the function:**
    * $F(30) = 3200e^{-0.15 \times 30}$
    * $F(30) = 3200e^{-4.5}$
3.  **Calculate the value:**
    * Using a calculator, $e^{-4.5} \approx 0.011109$.
    * $F(30) \approx 3200 \times 0.011109 \approx 35.55$.
4.  **Approximate the answer:** The closest whole number is 36.

**Final Answer:** The approximate population is **36**.

### **Question 5: Blue Whale Population (Finding Time)** (from file `image_c63196.png`)

**The Question:**
...using the same function $F(t) = 3200e^{-0.15t}$, in which year will the population of blue whales approximately be 160?

**Detailed Solution:**

1.  **Set the function equal to the target population:**
    * $160 = 3200e^{-0.15t}$
2.  **Isolate the exponential term:**
    * Divide both sides by 3200:
    * $\frac{160}{3200} = e^{-0.15t}$
    * $\frac{1}{20} = e^{-0.15t} \implies 0.05 = e^{-0.15t}$
3.  **Use the natural logarithm ($\ln$) to solve for the exponent:**
    * Take the natural log of both sides: $\ln(0.05) = \ln(e^{-0.15t})$
    * Using the property $\ln(e^x) = x$, we get: $\ln(0.05) = -0.15t$
4.  **Calculate and solve for $t$:**
    * Using a calculator, $\ln(0.05) \approx -2.9957$.
    * $-2.9957 = -0.15t$
    * $t = \frac{-2.9957}{-0.15} \approx 19.97$ years.
5.  **Find the year:**
    * We can round $t$ to approximately 20 years.
    * The year is $1990 + t = 1990 + 20 = 2010$.

**Final Answer:** The population will be approximately 160 in the year **2010**.

### **Question 6: Bacterial Growth Model** (from file `image_c63196.png`)

**The Question:**
Suppose the population of bacteria in a culture is growing exponentially. At today 2:00 pm, 100 bacteria were present and by 5:00 pm, 448 bacteria were present. Find an exponential function $y = ae^{kt}$ that models this growth...

**Detailed Solution:**

Let $t$ be the number of hours since 2:00 pm.

1.  **Use the first data point to find 'a' (the initial amount):**
    * At 2:00 pm, $t=0$ and the population $y=100$.
    * Substitute into the model: $y = ae^{kt}$
    * $100 = ae^{k \cdot 0} = ae^0 = a \cdot 1$
    * So, the initial amount **$a = 100$**.
    * Our model is now $y = 100e^{kt}$.

2.  **Use the second data point to find 'k' (the growth constant):**
    * At 5:00 pm, $t = 5 - 2 = 3$ hours have passed. The population is $y=448$.
    * The problem provides a hint to "Check from the given options" rather than solving for k directly. Let's test the options where $a=100$.
    * **Option: $y=100e^{0.5t}$**. Let's check if it works for our second point ($t=3, y=448$).
        * $y = 100e^{0.5 \times 3} = 100e^{1.5}$
        * Using a calculator, $e^{1.5} \approx 4.4817$.
        * $y \approx 100 \times 4.4817 = 448.17$. This is a very close match to 448.
    * **Option: $y=100e^{2t}$**. Let's check this one.
        * $y = 100e^{2 \times 3} = 100e^6$.
        * Using a calculator, $e^6 \approx 403.4$.
        * $y \approx 100 \times 403.4 = 40340$. This is not close to 448.

**Final Answer:** The function that models the growth is **$y = 100e^{0.5t}$**.
