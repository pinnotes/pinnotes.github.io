Good evening! Here in India on this Sunday, let's explore these questions involving logarithmic functions. The key to solving almost all of these problems is a solid understanding of the rules that govern the **domain of a logarithm**.

### **Core Concepts: The Domain of a Logarithm**

For any logarithmic function written in the form $f(x) = \log_b (A)$:

1.  **The Argument must be Positive:** The expression inside the logarithm, the argument ($A$), must be strictly greater than zero.
    $$A > 0$$
2.  **The Base must be Positive:** The base ($b$) must be strictly greater than zero.
    $$b > 0$$
3.  **The Base cannot be 1:** The base ($b$) cannot be equal to one.
    $$b \neq 1$$

You must satisfy all relevant conditions for the function to be defined.

### **Question 1: Solving a System of Log Equations** (from file `image_c5c0f4.png`)

**The Question:**
For which point on the Cartesian plane, will the equations $x = \log_2 y$ and $x = \log_{0.2} y$ be valid?
* (1, 1)
* (0, 1)
* (2, 1)
* (0, 2)

**Detailed Solution:**

1.  **Set the equations equal:** Since both equations are equal to $x$, we can set them equal to each other:
    $$\log_2 y = \log_{0.2} y$$
2.  **Analyze the equation:** A logarithm, $\log_b y$, asks the question: "To what power must I raise the base $b$ to get the argument $y$?" The only way for this power to be the same for two different bases (2 and 0.2) is if the argument $y$ makes the result trivial.
3.  The value of any logarithm is 0 when its argument is 1 (i.e., $\log_b 1 = 0$ for any valid base $b$). Let's test this.
4.  **Test y = 1:**
    * If $y=1$, the first equation becomes $x = \log_2 (1) = 0$.
    * If $y=1$, the second equation becomes $x = \log_{0.2} (1) = 0$.
5.  **Find the point:** Both equations give a result of $x=0$ when $y=1$. This means the point $(0, 1)$ satisfies both equations.

**Final Answer:** The correct option is **(0, 1)**.

### **Question 2: Domain of a Simple Logarithm** (from file `image_c5c0f4.png`)

**The Question:**
The domain of $f(x) = \log_2(2-x)$ is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
* $(-\infty, 1)$
* $(-\infty, 2)$
* $(\infty, 1]$
* $(\infty, 2]$

**Core Concept:** The argument of any logarithm must be strictly positive.

**Detailed Solution:**

1.  **Identify the argument:** In the function $f(x) = \log_2(2-x)$, the argument is $(2-x)$.
2.  **Set the argument to be greater than zero:**
    $$2 - x > 0$$
3.  **Solve the inequality for x:**
    * Add $x$ to both sides: $2 > x$.
    * This is the same as $x < 2$.
4.  **Write in interval notation:** The set of all numbers less than 2 is the interval from negative infinity up to (but not including) 2.

**Final Answer:** The domain is **$(-\infty, 2)$**.

### **Question 3: Domain of a Nested Logarithm** (from file `image_c5c0f4.png`)

**The Question:**
Consider the function $f(x) = \log_{10}((\log_{10} x)^2 - 8\log_{10}x + 15)$. What is the domain of $f$?

**Detailed Solution:**

We have two conditions to satisfy for this nested logarithm.

1.  **Condition 1: Argument of the inner logarithm must be positive.**
    * The inner logarithm is $\log_{10}x$. Its argument is $x$.
    * Therefore, we must have **$x > 0$**.

2.  **Condition 2: Argument of the outer logarithm must be positive.**
    * The argument of the outer log is the entire expression $(\log_{10}x)^2 - 8\log_{10}x + 15$.
    * So, we must solve the inequality: $(\log_{10}x)^2 - 8\log_{10}x + 15 > 0$.
    * This is a quadratic inequality. Let $u = \log_{10}x$. The inequality becomes:
        $u^2 - 8u + 15 > 0$
    * Factor the quadratic: $(u-3)(u-5) > 0$.
    * The roots are $u=3$ and $u=5$. Since this is an upward-opening parabola, the expression is positive when $u$ is *outside* the roots.
    * So, we need $u < 3$ or $u > 5$.
3.  **Substitute back and solve for x:**
    * Substitute $u = \log_{10}x$ back into the inequalities:
        * $\log_{10}x < 3$  OR  $\log_{10}x > 5$
    * Convert to exponential form:
        * $x < 10^3$  OR  $x > 10^5$
        * $x < 1000$  OR  $x > 100000$

4.  **Combine all conditions:**
    * We need to satisfy Condition 1 **AND** Condition 2.
    * We need $x > 0$ **AND** ($x < 1000$ or $x > 100000$).
    * The intersection of these gives two separate intervals: $(0, 1000)$ and $(100000, \infty)$.

**Final Answer:** The domain is **$(0, 10^3) \cup (10^5, \infty)$**.

### **Question 4: Domain from the Logarithm Base** (from file `image_c5c098.png`)

**The Question:**
The set of all $x$ for which there are no functions of the form $f(x) = \log_{\frac{x}{x+1}}\left(\frac{x^3-1}{x^3-1}\right)$ is?

**Core Concept:** The question is asking for the set of x-values where the function is **not defined**. A logarithm is not defined if its base is not positive or if its base is equal to 1.

**Detailed Solution:**

1.  **Analyze the Argument:** The argument is $\frac{x^3-1}{x^3-1} = 1$, which is valid as long as the denominator is not zero (i.e., $x \neq 1$). The argument of a logarithm can be 1.

2.  **Analyze the Base:** The base is $b = \frac{x}{x+1}$. It has two conditions to be a valid base.
    * **Condition A (Base must not be 1):** $\frac{x}{x+1} \neq 1 \implies x \neq x+1 \implies 0 \neq 1$. This is always true, so the base is never 1.
    * **Condition B (Base must be positive):** We need to find where the base is **NOT** positive, i.e., where $\frac{x}{x+1} \le 0$.
3.  **Solve the inequality $\frac{x}{x+1} \le 0$:**
    * The critical points where the expression can change sign are the roots of the numerator ($x=0$) and the denominator ($x=-1$).
    * We can test the intervals around these points:
        * If $x < -1$ (e.g., -2): $\frac{-2}{-1} = +2$ (Positive, so function is defined here).
        * If $-1 < x < 0$ (e.g., -0.5): $\frac{-0.5}{+0.5} = -1$ (Negative, so function is **not defined** here).
        * If $x > 0$ (e.g., 5): $\frac{5}{6}$ (Positive, so function is defined here).
    * We also need to check the critical points themselves.
        * At $x=0$, the base is $0$, which is not positive. So the function is **not defined**.
        * At $x=-1$, the base is undefined. So the function is **not defined**.
4.  **Combine the results:** The function is not defined when $x=-1$, when $x=0$, and for all values between them. This is the interval $[-1, 0]$. We must also include the point $x=1$ where the argument is undefined. The full set of invalid points is $[-1, 0] \cup \{1\}$.

**Final Answer:** The closest and most encompassing option provided is **$[-1, 1]$**.

### **Question 5: Domain of a Complex Logarithm** (from file `image_c5c098.png`)

**The Question:**
What is the domain of the function $f(x) = \log(-(xe^{3x} - 27x))$?

**Core Concept:** The argument of the logarithm must be strictly greater than zero.

**Detailed Solution:**

1.  **Set the argument to be greater than zero:**
    $$-(xe^{3x} - 27x) > 0$$
2.  **Simplify the inequality:**
    * Multiply by -1 and remember to **flip the inequality sign**:
    * $xe^{3x} - 27x < 0$
3.  **Factor the expression:**
    * Factor out the common term $x$:
    * $x(e^{3x} - 27) < 0$
4.  **Find the critical points** (where the expression equals zero):
    * The first factor gives a critical point at $x=0$.
    * The second factor gives a critical point when $e^{3x} - 27 = 0 \implies e^{3x} = 27$.
        * Take the natural log of both sides: $\ln(e^{3x}) = \ln(27)$
        * $3x = \ln(3^3) = 3\ln(3)$
        * $x = \ln(3)$
5.  **Analyze the sign of the expression $x(e^{3x} - 27)$ in the intervals:**
    * Our critical points are $0$ and $\ln(3)$ (which is approximately 1.1).
    * **Interval 1: $x < 0$**. Let $x=-1$. The first factor ($x$) is negative. The second factor ($e^{-3}-27$) is negative. The product is $(-)(-) = (+)$. We want less than zero, so this is not part of the domain.
    * **Interval 2: $0 < x < \ln(3)$**. Let $x=1$. The first factor ($x$) is positive. The second factor ($e^3-27 \approx 20.1-27$) is negative. The product is $(+)(-) = (-)$. This is less than zero, so this **is** part of the domain.
    * **Interval 3: $x > \ln(3)$**. Let $x=2$. The first factor ($x$) is positive. The second factor ($e^6-27$) is positive. The product is $(+)(+) = (+)$. Not part of the domain.

**Final Answer:** The domain is the interval where the product is negative, which is **$(0, \ln3)$**.
