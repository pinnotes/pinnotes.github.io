Hello! On this Wednesday evening here in India, I can certainly help you with these questions, which focus on creating and analyzing quadratic equations from their roots and graphs.

### **Question 1: Forming a Quadratic Equation from its Roots** (from file `image_fffac0.png`)

**The Question:**
Choose the correct standard form of a quadratic equation with roots $\frac{7}{2}$ and $-\frac{10}{3}$.

**Core Concept: From Roots to Standard Form**

If a quadratic equation has roots $r_1$ and $r_2$, it can be written in factored form as:
$$(x - r_1)(x - r_2) = 0$$
To get to the standard form ($ax^2 + bx + c = 0$), we expand this expression and clear any fractions.

**Detailed Solution:**

1.  **Identify the roots:**
    * $r_1 = \frac{7}{2}$
    * $r_2 = -\frac{10}{3}$

2.  **Write the equation in factored form:**
    $$\left(x - \frac{7}{2}\right)\left(x - \left(-\frac{10}{3}\right)\right) = 0$$ $$\left(x - \frac{7}{2}\right)\left(x + \frac{10}{3}\right) = 0$$
    (Note: This is one of the options, but it is not the *standard form* with integer coefficients).

3.  **Clear the fractions inside the parentheses:**
    * Multiply the first parenthesis by 2 and the second by 3. To keep the equation balanced, we can think of this as:
    $$\frac{1}{2}(2x - 7) \cdot \frac{1}{3}(3x + 10) = 0$$ $$\frac{1}{6}(2x - 7)(3x + 10) = 0$$
4.  **Multiply the entire equation by 6 to eliminate the fraction:**
    $$(2x - 7)(3x + 10) = 0$$
5.  **Expand the expression using the FOIL method (First, Outer, Inner, Last):**
    * (First) $2x \cdot 3x = 6x^2$
    * (Outer) $2x \cdot 10 = +20x$
    * (Inner) $-7 \cdot 3x = -21x$
    * (Last) $-7 \cdot 10 = -70$
    * Combine them: $6x^2 + 20x - 21x - 70 = 0$

6.  **Simplify by combining like terms:**
    $$6x^2 - x - 70 = 0$$

**Final Answer:** The correct standard form is **$6x^2 - x - 70 = 0$**.

### **Question 2: Analyzing the Graph of a Parabola** (from file `image_fffa7b.png`)

**The Question:**
Choose the correct option about $a$ with the help of Figure AQ-5.1.
(The figure shows an upward-opening parabola with equation $y = a(x + 2)(b - x)$)

**Core Concept: Parabola Direction and the Leading Coefficient**

The leading coefficient of a quadratic equation determines whether its parabola opens upwards or downwards. For an equation $y = Ax^2 + Bx + C$:
* If $A > 0$ (positive), the parabola opens **upwards** ($\cup$).
* If $A < 0$ (negative), the parabola opens **downwards** ($\cap$).

This question is tricky because the equation is in factored form. We must first determine the sign of the $x^2$ term after expansion.

**Detailed Solution:**

1.  **Analyze the graph:** The parabola in the figure clearly opens **upwards**. This means its leading coefficient ($A$) must be positive.

2.  **Analyze the equation:** The equation is $y = a(x + 2)(b - x)$.
3.  **Find the $x^2$ term:** To find the leading coefficient, we only need to multiply the terms containing $x$ from each part of the equation:
    * $a \times (x) \times (-x) = a(-x^2) = -ax^2$
4.  **Relate the equation to the graph:**
    * The leading coefficient of the expanded equation is $-a$.
    * Since the parabola opens upwards, this leading coefficient must be positive.
    * Therefore, we have the inequality: $-a > 0$.
5.  **Solve for $a$:**
    * To solve for $a$, we must multiply (or divide) both sides by -1. When you multiply or divide an inequality by a negative number, you **must flip the inequality sign**.
    * $a < 0$

**Final Answer:** The correct option is **$a < 0$**.

### **Question 3: Finding Roots of Quadratic Functions** (from file `image_fff71c.png`)

**The Question:**
Choose the set of correct options regarding quadratic functions $p(x) = x^2 - 7x + 10$ and $q(x) = x^2 + 7x + 10$. (Multiple Select Question)

**Core Concept: Finding Roots by Factoring**

To find the roots of a quadratic equation $x^2 + bx + c = 0$, we look for two numbers that multiply to give the constant term ($c$) and add to give the coefficient of the x-term ($b$).

**Detailed Solution:**

**Part 1: Find the roots of $p(x) = x^2 - 7x + 10$**

1.  We need two numbers that **multiply to +10** and **add to -7**.
2.  To get a positive product and a negative sum, both numbers must be negative. The numbers are **-5 and -2**.
3.  The factored form is $(x - 5)(x - 2) = 0$.
4.  The roots are $x=5$ and $x=2$.
5.  So, the statement **"p(x) has two roots 5 and 2" is TRUE**.

**Part 2: Find the roots of $q(x) = x^2 + 7x + 10$**

1.  We need two numbers that **multiply to +10** and **add to +7**.
2.  The numbers are **+5 and +2**.
3.  The factored form is $(x + 5)(x + 2) = 0$.
4.  The roots are $x=-5$ and $x=-2$.
5.  So, the statement **"q(x) has two roots -5 and -2" is TRUE**.

**Final Answer:** The correct options are:
* **$p(x)$ has two roots 5 and 2**
* **$q(x)$ has two roots -5 and -2**

### **Question 4: Analyzing Roots of a Quadratic Equation** (from file `image_fff71c.png`)

**The Question:**
Identify the incorrect options for the quadratic equation $x^2 - 15x + 54 = 0$. (Multiple Select Question)
* 9 is a root
* Both the roots are equal
* There are no roots
* 6 is a root

**Core Concept: Finding and Analyzing Roots**

First, find the roots of the equation. Then, evaluate each statement to see if it is true or false. The question asks for the **incorrect** statements.

**Detailed Solution:**

1.  **Find the roots of $x^2 - 15x + 54 = 0$:**
    * We need two numbers that **multiply to +54** and **add to -15**.
    * Let's list factor pairs of 54: (1, 54), (2, 27), (3, 18), (6, 9).
    * The pair (6, 9) adds to 15. To get a sum of -15, both numbers must be negative: **-6 and -9**.
    * The factored form is $(x - 6)(x - 9) = 0$.
    * The roots are $x=6$ and $x=9$.

2.  **Evaluate the given options:**
    * **"9 is a root"**: This is **TRUE**.
    * **"Both the roots are equal"**: This is **FALSE**. The roots are 6 and 9, which are distinct.
    * **"There are no roots"**: This is **FALSE**. There are two real roots, 6 and 9.
    * **"6 is a root"**: This is **TRUE**.

3.  **Identify the incorrect options:**
    * The question asks us to choose the statements that are incorrect. Based on our analysis, two statements are false.

**Final Answer:** The incorrect options are:
* **Both the roots are equal**
* **There are no roots**
