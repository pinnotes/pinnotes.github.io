Good morning! Here in India on this Saturday, let's tackle these questions about quadratic equations. The key to understanding most of these problems lies in a powerful tool called the **discriminant**.

### **Core Concept: The Discriminant ($ax^2 + bx + c = 0$)**

For any quadratic equation, the **roots** (or solutions) can be found using the quadratic formula:
$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$
The part under the square root, **$b^2 - 4ac$**, is called the **discriminant**, often represented by the symbol delta ($\Delta$). The value of the discriminant tells you about the *nature* of the roots without having to fully solve the equation.

* If **$\Delta > 0$** (positive), you will get two different answers because of the $\pm$ sign. This means the equation has **two distinct real roots**.
* If **$\Delta = 0$**, the square root term becomes zero, and you only get one answer. This means the equation has **one repeated real root** (also called "equal roots").
* If **$\Delta < 0$** (negative), the square root is of a negative number, which is not a real number. This means the equation has **no real roots**.

### **Question 1: Nature of Roots** (from file `image_a4dfbe.png`)

**The Question:**
The quadratic equation $9x^2 + 6x + 1 = 0$ has
* Two distinct roots
* Equal roots
* No roots
* Inadequate information

**Core Concept:** We can determine the nature of the roots by calculating the discriminant ($\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$).

**Detailed Solution:**

1.  **Identify the coefficients** from the equation $9x^2 + 6x + 1 = 0$:
    * $a = 9$
    * $b = 6$
    * $c = 1$
2.  **Calculate the discriminant:**
    * $\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$
    * $\Delta = (6)^2 - 4(9)(1)$
    * $\Delta = 36 - 36 = 0$
3.  **Interpret the result:**
    * Since the discriminant is exactly 0, the equation has one repeated real root, which is the same as having "equal roots".

**Final Answer:** The equation has **Equal roots**.

### **Question 2: Same Discriminant** (from file `image_a4dfbe.png`)

**The Question:**
If two different quadratic equations have same discriminant then choose the correct option.
* The roots of both equation will always be same
* The roots of both equation will always be real
* The roots of both equation will always be distinct
* Discriminant can not determine the relation between the roots of two different equations

**Core Concept:** The discriminant only determines the *nature* of the roots (how many and what type), not their actual values. The values of the roots also depend on the '$a$' and '$b$' coefficients from the full quadratic formula.

**Detailed Solution:**

Let's test this with an example.
* **Equation 1:** $x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0$.
    * Discriminant: $\Delta = (-4)^2 - 4(1)(3) = 16 - 12 = 4$.
    * Roots: $(x-1)(x-3)=0 \implies x=1, x=3$.
* **Equation 2:** $x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0$.
    * Discriminant: $\Delta = (-6)^2 - 4(1)(8) = 36 - 32 = 4$.
    * Roots: $(x-2)(x-4)=0 \implies x=2, x=4$.

Both equations have the same discriminant ($\Delta = 4$), which correctly tells us that both have two distinct real roots. However, the roots themselves (1, 3 vs 2, 4) are completely different.

Therefore, the discriminant only tells you about the *type* of roots within one equation. It cannot be used to compare the actual root *values* of two different equations.

**Final Answer:** **Discriminant can not determine the relation between the roots of two different equations**.

### **Question 3: Finding the Roots** (from file `image_a4dc56.png`)

**The Question:**
What will the roots of equation $2x^2 - x - 10 = 0$ be?

**Core Concept:** When factoring is not immediately obvious, the quadratic formula is a reliable method to find the exact roots of any quadratic equation.

**Detailed Solution:**

1.  **Identify the coefficients** from the equation $2x^2 - x - 10 = 0$:
    * $a = 2$
    * $b = -1$
    * $c = -10$
2.  **Apply the quadratic formula:**
    $$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$ $$x = \frac{-(-1) \pm \sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(2)(-10)}}{2(2)}$$
3.  **Simplify the expression:**
    $$x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 - (-80)}}{4}$$$$x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 80}}{4}$$$$x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{81}}{4}$$ $$x = \frac{1 \pm 9}{4}$$
4.  **Calculate the two separate roots:**
    * Root 1: $x_1 = \frac{1 + 9}{4} = \frac{10}{4} = \frac{5}{2}$
    * Root 2: $x_2 = \frac{1 - 9}{4} = \frac{-8}{4} = -2$

**Final Answer:** The roots are **-2 and 5/2**.

### **Question 4: Identifying Distinct Real Roots** (from file `image_a4dc56.png`)

**The Question:**
Which of the following gives distinct real roots? (Multiple Select Question)
* $69x^2 - 42x - 56 = 0$
* $69x^2 - 10x + 560 = 0$
* $9x^2 - 10x + 1 = 0$
* $9x^2 - 10x - 1 = 0$

**Core Concept:** An equation has **distinct real roots** if and only if its discriminant ($\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$) is **greater than 0** (positive).

**Detailed Solution:**

We need to calculate the discriminant for each equation.

* **Equation 1:** $69x^2 - 42x - 56 = 0$
    * $\Delta = (-42)^2 - 4(69)(-56) = 1764 + 15456 = 17220$.
    * Since $\Delta > 0$, this equation has **distinct real roots**.

* **Equation 2:** $69x^2 - 10x + 560 = 0$
    * $\Delta = (-10)^2 - 4(69)(560) = 100 - 154560 = -154460$.
    * Since $\Delta < 0$, this equation has no real roots.

* **Equation 3:** $9x^2 - 10x + 1 = 0$
    * $\Delta = (-10)^2 - 4(9)(1) = 100 - 36 = 64$.
    * Since $\Delta > 0$, this equation has **distinct real roots**.

* **Equation 4:** $9x^2 - 10x - 1 = 0$
    * $\Delta = (-10)^2 - 4(9)(-1) = 100 + 36 = 136$.
    * Since $\Delta > 0$, this equation has **distinct real roots**.

**Final Answer:** The equations that give distinct real roots are:
* $69x^2 - 42x - 56 = 0$
* $9x^2 - 10x + 1 = 0$
* $9x^2 - 10x - 1 = 0$
