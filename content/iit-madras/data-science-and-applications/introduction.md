## A) Data Science ðŸ§ 

 `IIT Madras` has launched the BS in `Data Science and Applications`. In this program, the course
 contents are delivered online and can be studied by anyone from anywhere, while the monthly
 quizzes and final semester exams will have to be attended in-person at designated centres.

#### Depending on the number of courses completed, learners can earn

- a Foundation level certificate
- Diploma in Programming/Diploma in Data Science or both
- BSc degree in `Programming and Data Science`
- BS degree in `Data Science and Applications`
  
### 1. Highlights of the Programme

 Courses are taught by faculty of `IIT Madras`/other reputed institutes as well as experts from
 the industry.

 Unlike many competitive admission exams which work on the philosophy of elimination and
 selection and admit a very limited number of learners into various programmes based on their
 performance relative to that of others, in this programme there are specific qualifying criteria,
 and a significantly large number of learners can enter.

 Learners of any background, be it `engineering`, `sciences`, `humanities`, `arts`, `medicine`, `law`, etc
 can attempt and join this programme.

There is no limitation on the age of the learner or their geographical location.

### 2. Flexibility

 There are two entry and four exit points, with learners being able to exit with either course
 `certificates`, or `diploma` or the `degree`. Learners can choose their pace of study every term.
 Being an online programme, there is no geographical barrier to learning from this programme- learners only need to travel to exam centres for exams each term.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This programme is **NOT BASED** on an admission process.
 Qualified learners can attempt respective stages of the programme and those who clear each
 stage will receive the certificate corresponding to that stage alone.

So, for example, the learner should be aware that they are not being admitted to a degree
 programme after the `Qualifier`. It is only for the set of Foundation courses, which on
 successful completion makes them eligible to enter the `Diploma level`. The diplomas or
 degrees are obtained by the candidate only when the requisite number of credits are accrued
 by completing the courses prescribed and satisfying any other mandatory criteria.

 Admission to any level does not automatically entitle the learner to exit the programme with
 the Diploma or the degree.
