# What are the admission criteria for the IIT Madras BS Data Science programme

The admission criteria for the IIT Madras BS Degree in Data Science and Applications are designed to be flexible and inclusive, allowing students from diverse backgrounds to apply. Here are the main criteria and entry routes:

## Admission Criteria

- **Eligibility**
    - **Class 12 Completion:** Applicants must have completed Class 12 (or equivalent) from any stream (Science, Commerce, Arts, etc.). There is no age restriction[^1][^2][^5].
    - **Class 10 Requirements:** Applicants must have studied Mathematics and English in Class 10[^1][^2][^5].
    - **Class 11 Students:** Those who have completed Class 11 may apply, but must pass Class 12 before joining the main program[^1][^2].
    - **International Students:** Foreign nationals with a valid Indian passport or equivalent documentation can apply[^2].
- **Admission Routes**
    - **Regular Entry (Qualifier Process):**
        - Applicants must complete a four-week online preparatory module (qualifier process) covering English, Mathematics, Statistics, and Computational Thinking.
        - Weekly assignments must be submitted and scored. The best scores are considered for eligibility to appear for the in-person qualifier exam.
        - Minimum assignment scores required for eligibility vary by category:
            - **General:** 40% in each course
            - **SC/ST/PwD:** 30% in each course
            - **OBC-NCL/EWS:** 35% in each course[^1][^2]
        - Eligible candidates then take an in-person qualifier exam. Cut-off scores for passing the exam:
            - **General:** 50% overall and 40% in each subject
            - **SC/ST/PwD:** 40% overall and 30% in each subject
            - **OBC-NCL/EWS:** 45% overall and 35% in each subject[^1][^2]
        - Upon passing the qualifier exam, candidates are eligible to register for the Foundation Level courses.
    - **JEE Advanced-Based Entry:**
        - Applicants who have qualified for JEE Advanced in the current or previous years can apply for direct entry to the Foundation Level.
        - They must complete the first four weeks of foundational coursework and appear for an in-person quiz and exam. The score determines the number of courses they can register for in the first term[^1][^2][^5].
    - **JEE Main-Based Entry:**
        - Some sources mention direct admission for JEE Main qualifiers, but the official program primarily highlights JEE Advanced for direct entry to the Foundation Level. Always check the latest official guidelines[^5].
- **No Competitive Elimination:**
Admission is not based on relative performance or seat limits. All candidates who meet the qualifying criteria are admitted[^5].
