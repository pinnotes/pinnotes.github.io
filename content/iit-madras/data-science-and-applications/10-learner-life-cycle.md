## Learner Life Cycle in the IIT Madras BS Degree Programme

The learner life cycle in the IIT Madras BS Degree in Data Science and Applications outlines the different stages and statuses a student may experience from admission to completion or exit. This process is designed to provide flexibility, support, and clear progression criteria for all learners[^1].

---

### **Stages of the Learner Life Cycle**

**1. Admission and Registration**

- After clearing the Qualifier Exam, a learner becomes eligible to register for Foundation level courses.
- Registration is done using a personal email ID. Upon document approval and fee payment, the learner receives an official roll number and IITM email ID, which is used for all subsequent communications and course access[^1].

**2. Active Status**

- When a learner is registered for one or more courses in a term (after fee payment), their status is "On the rolls/Active."
- All program communications, assignments, and exams are accessed via the official IITM email[^1].

**3. Academic Probation**

- If a learner skips registering for courses in a term, they are placed on "Academic Probation."
- A learner may skip up to two consecutive terms without registering for any courses. During this period, the official email remains active.
- To maintain status, the learner can pay a "Registration Keep Alive" (RKA) fee per term. If not paid, a penalty is added when re-registering[^1].

**4. Struck Off the Rolls**

- If a learner remains on Academic Probation for two consecutive terms and does not register in the next term, their status changes to "Struck off the rolls," and the official email is suspended.
- To reactivate, the learner must pay a readmission fee and any pending RKA fees. After two such removals, the learner is permanently removed from the program[^1].

**5. Quitting the Programme**

- Learners may voluntarily quit the program at any time via their dashboard. The official email is deactivated, and the personal email is reactivated for dashboard access.
- Rejoining after quitting is not possible[^1].

**6. Alumnus Status**

- Upon successful completion of the BSc or BS degree and exiting the program, the learner‚Äôs status becomes "Alumnus." The official email is deactivated, and the personal email is used for future communications[^1].

### **Progression and Exit Points**

- **Multiple Entry and Exit Points:**
Learners can enter at the Foundation, Diploma, or Degree levels (via different qualifying routes) and exit with a Foundation Certificate, Diploma(s), BSc, or BS degree, depending on credits earned[^1].
- **Course Registration:**
Each term, learners register for courses within their "Credit Clearing Capability" (CCC), which is based on past performance. Prerequisites must be met for advanced courses[^1].
- **Completion Requirements:**
    - Each level (Foundation, Diploma, BSc, BS) has a maximum duration (typically 3 years/9 terms per level, 8 years/24 terms for the entire program).
    - There are checkpoints to ensure progress; failure to meet minimum course completions in set timeframes can result in removal from the program[^1].

### **Learner Status Table**

| Status | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| On the rolls/Active | Registered for at least one course in the current term |
| Academic Probation | Not registered for any course in a term (allowed for up to two consecutive terms) |
| Struck off the rolls | Absent for three consecutive terms; must pay to reactivate (max two times allowed) |
| Quit the programme | Voluntarily exited; cannot rejoin |
| Alumnus | Successfully completed BSc/BS degree and exited |


---

### **Key Points**

- **Flexibility:** Learners can choose their pace and take breaks, but must adhere to maximum allowed gaps.
- **Support:** Status changes are communicated, and learners are given warnings and opportunities to reactivate.
- **Completion:** Only upon meeting all requirements and credits does a learner become an alumnus; otherwise, exit is at the last completed level[^1].

This structured learner life cycle ensures that students have clear guidelines for progression, opportunities for re-engagement, and defined outcomes at each stage of the IIT Madras BS Degree Programme in Data Science and Applications[^1].
