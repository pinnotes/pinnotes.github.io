## Course Registration in the IIT Madras BS Degree Programme

Course registration is a structured, term-wise process that determines how students enroll in courses for each trimester of the IIT Madras BS Degree in Data Science and Applications. The process is designed to provide flexibility while ensuring academic progression and adherence to prerequisites.

### **Steps Involved in Course Registration**

1. **Registration Window**
    - At the start of each term, a registration window opens during which students can select courses for the upcoming term.
    - Students must complete registration and pay the corresponding course fees within this window[^1].
2. **Credit Clearing Capability (CCC)**
    - The maximum number of courses a student can register for in a term is determined by their Credit Clearing Capability (CCC).
    - CCC is based on the average marks of passed courses in previous terms:
        - If average marks (M) are:
            - 0 < M ≤ 50: Max 2 courses
            - 50 < M ≤ 70: Max 3 courses
            - M > 70: Max 4 courses
    - In the first term after qualifying, CCC is set to 4 for all students[^1].
3. **Course Selection**
    - Students choose courses up to their CCC limit.
    - Only courses for which prerequisites have been completed can be selected.
    - Students cannot register for courses across different levels in the same term (e.g., Foundation and Diploma courses together)[^1].
4. **Exam City Selection**
    - During registration, students must select two preferred cities for in-person quizzes and final exams for that term.
    - These can be changed each term as needed[^1].
5. **Payment**
    - Fees are paid only for the courses registered in that term.
    - Payment is done online through the portal[^1].
6. **Confirmation and Status**
    - Upon successful registration and payment, the student’s status is marked as “Active.”
    - If a student does not register for any courses in a term, they are placed on “Academic Probation.” Skipping two consecutive terms without registering leads to “Struck off the rolls” status[^1].

### **Additional Registration Rules**

- **Prerequisites**
    - Each course has specific prerequisites that must be met before registration.
    - For example, to register for Mathematics 2, a student must have passed Mathematics 1[^1].
- **Dropping Courses**
    - Courses can be dropped within four weeks of the term start date, with partial fee deduction (₹2,000 for Foundation, ₹4,000 for Diploma/Degree courses)[^1].
    - Dropping all courses in a term places the student on Academic Probation[^1].
- **Repeating Courses**
    - If a student fails or is absent for a course, they must repeat it in a future term, subject to CCC limits.
    - Courses can also be repeated for grade improvement (at double the regular fee)[^1].
- **Term Limits**
    - Each level has a maximum duration for completion (e.g., Foundation: 9 terms, Diploma: 12 terms)[^1].
- **Registration Keep Alive (RKA)**
    - If a student skips a term, they can pay an RKA fee to keep their registration and email active[^1].
