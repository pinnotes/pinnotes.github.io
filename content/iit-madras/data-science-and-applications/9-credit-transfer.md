## Credit Transfer in the IIT Madras BS Degree Programme

The IIT Madras BS Degree in Data Science and Applications offers structured options for credit transfer, allowing students to incorporate relevant coursework from NPTEL/SWAYAM and IIT Madras campus courses into their degree requirements. Here are the key details:

---

### **1. Credit Transfer from NPTEL/SWAYAM Courses**

- **Eligibility and Limits:**
    - **BSc Level:** Up to **4 credits** from approved NPTEL technical courses can be transferred.
    - **BS Level:** Up to **8 credits** (including up to 4 credits in the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSMG) category) can be transferred.
- **Course Requirements:**
    - Only courses listed as approved by the BS programme can be transferred. The lists are updated periodically and available via the programme’s website.
    - Only SWAYAM NPTEL *certification courses* are eligible.
- **Process:**
    - Register for NPTEL courses using your official IITM BS programme email ID.
    - Complete the course and the NPTEL exam.
    - Apply for credit transfer to the BS programme, providing an undertaking that the course is being credited only to the IITM BS Degree.
- **Fees:**
    - **₹1,000 per credit** for credit transfer (separate from NPTEL exam fees).
- **Grading:**
    - Transferred NPTEL courses are marked as PASS/FAIL and **do not contribute to CGPA**.
- **Timing:**
    - NPTEL courses can be completed any time after joining the Foundation Level, but credits are transferred only at the BSc or BS levels.
- **Other Notes:**
    - Each NPTEL course can be credited only once and only to one programme (either your college degree or the BS degree, not both).
    - If only doing credit transfer in a term (not registering for any IITM BS courses), you must pay the Registration Keep Alive (RKA) fee.

    - **HSMG Category:** A maximum of 8 credits in the HSMG category (including NPTEL) can be transferred at the BS level.

### **4. Important Rules and Notes**
