## Direct Entry into the Diploma Programme (IIT Madras BS Data Science \& Applications)

The IIT Madras BS Degree in Data Science and Applications offers a **Direct Entry into the Diploma Programme** for learners who already have a strong academic foundation. This pathway is primarily designed for working professionals and students who have completed at least two years of undergraduate study.

---

### **Eligibility Criteria**

- **Academic Requirement:**
Applicants must have completed at least **2 years in any undergraduate degree programme**.
    - Proof: A second-year marksheet or higher must be submitted as evidence.

---

### **Qualifying Process**

- **Separate Qualifier Exam:**
    - A specific **Direct Admission to Diploma (DAD) qualifier exam** is conducted for each diploma:
        - **Diploma in Programming (DP)**
        - **Diploma in Data Science (DS)**
    - The DAD qualifier exams are held **three times a year**, coinciding with the end-term exams of the main BS programme.
- **Exam Structure:**
    - **DAD-DP (Programming Diploma):**
        - 3-hour exam
        - Subjects: English, Aptitude, and 6 weeks of Mathematics 1
        - After qualifying, students must study Computational Thinking and Introduction to Python before proceeding to diploma subjects.
    - **DAD-DS (Data Science Diploma):**
        - 4-hour exam
        - Subjects: English, Mathematics 1, Statistics 1, and Python Programming
        - After qualifying, students must start with Mathematics 2 and Statistics 2, then continue with diploma subjects.
- **Passing Criteria:**
    - **General/OBC:**
        - Fee: ‚Çπ6,000
        - Minimum: 40/100 in each subject, 50/100 overall average
    - **SC/ST/PwD:**
        - Fee: ‚Çπ3,000 (SC/ST/PwD), ‚Çπ1,500 (SC/ST and PwD)
        - Minimum: 30/100 in each subject, 40/100 overall average
    - **OBC-NCL/EWS:**
        - Fee: ‚Çπ6,000
        - Minimum: 35/100 in each subject, 45/100 overall average
- **Attempts:**

- **Exit:**
    - Learners can **exit with one or both diplomas** from IIT Madras if they do not wish to pursue the full degree.
- **Further Progression:**
    - Students who complete the **Diploma in Data Science by direct admission** are eligible to pursue the **Diploma in Programming** without another qualifier.
    - However, those who complete the **Diploma in Programming** and wish to pursue the **Diploma in Data Science** must appear for the DAD-DS qualifier, as they would not have completed the required statistics and mathematics courses.

---

### **Key Points**

- **Designed for:** Working professionals or students with sufficient foundational knowledge who wish to fast-track their learning or only earn a diploma.
