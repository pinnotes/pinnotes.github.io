### Question 1: Basic Vector Operations

**Problem**
Choose the set of correct options using Figure M2W1AQ1.
(The figure shows points A(1, 2) and B(2, 3) which can be represented by vectors `A = (1, 2)` and `B = (2, 3)`).

**Options**
* `2A` is the vector `(2, 4)`.
* `3B` is the vector `(6, 9)`.
* `A + B` is the vector `(3, 5)`. (Assuming a typo in the original option)
* `A - B` is the vector `(-1, -1)`.

***

#### **Correct Options**
* `2A` is the vector `(2, 4)`.
* `3B` is the vector `(6, 9)`.
* `A + B` is the vector `(3, 5)`.
* `A - B` is the vector `(-1, -1)`.

#### **Concepts Explained üí°**
Vector operations are performed coordinate-wise.
* **Scalar Multiplication:** To multiply a vector by a scalar (a number), you multiply each component of the vector by that scalar.
    * `k * (x, y) = (k*x, k*y)`
* **Vector Addition/Subtraction:** To add or subtract vectors, you add or subtract their corresponding components.
    * `(x‚ÇÅ, y‚ÇÅ) + (x‚ÇÇ, y‚ÇÇ) = (x‚ÇÅ + x‚ÇÇ, y‚ÇÅ + y‚ÇÇ)`
    * `(x‚ÇÅ, y‚ÇÅ) - (x‚ÇÇ, y‚ÇÇ) = (x‚ÇÅ - x‚ÇÇ, y‚ÇÅ - y‚ÇÇ)`

#### **Step-by-Step Solution**
* **`2A`**: `2 * (1, 2) = (2 * 1, 2 * 2) = (2, 4)`
* **`3B`**: `3 * (2, 3) = (3 * 2, 3 * 3) = (6, 9)`
* **`A + B`**: `(1, 2) + (2, 3) = (1 + 2, 2 + 3) = (3, 5)`
* **`A - B`**: `(1, 2) - (2, 3) = (1 - 2, 2 - 3) = (-1, -1)`

All the statements are correct.

### Question 2: Linear Combination of Vectors

**Problem**
Let `V‚ÇÅ = (1, 1)`, `V‚ÇÇ = (1, 0)`, and `V‚ÇÉ = (0, 1)` be three vectors. Find out the correct set of options.

**Options**
* `(2, 3) = 2V‚ÇÅ + 0V‚ÇÇ + V‚ÇÉ`
* `(2, 3) = 0V‚ÇÅ + 2V‚ÇÇ + 3V‚ÇÉ`
* `(2, 3) = 2V‚ÇÅ + V‚ÇÇ + 0V‚ÇÉ`
* `(2, 3) = 0V‚ÇÅ + 3V‚ÇÇ + 2V‚ÇÉ`

***

#### **Correct Options**
* `(2, 3) = 2V‚ÇÅ + 0V‚ÇÇ + V‚ÇÉ`
* `(2, 3) = 0V‚ÇÅ + 2V‚ÇÇ + 3V‚ÇÉ`

#### **Concepts Explained üí°**
A **linear combination** of vectors is an expression constructed from a set of vectors by multiplying each vector by a scalar and adding the results. To check if an equation is true, simply calculate the right-hand side and see if it equals the left-hand side.

#### **Step-by-Step Solution**
We evaluate the right-hand side for each option:
* **Option 1:** `2(1, 1) + 0(1, 0) + 1(0, 1) = (2, 2) + (0, 0) + (0, 1) = (2, 3)`. **This is correct.**
* **Option 2:** `0(1, 1) + 2(1, 0) + 3(0, 1) = (0, 0) + (2, 0) + (0, 3) = (2, 3)`. **This is correct.**
* **Option 3:** `2(1, 1) + 1(1, 0) + 0(0, 1) = (2, 2) + (1, 0) + (0, 0) = (3, 2)`. This is incorrect.
* **Option 4:** `0(1, 1) + 3(1, 0) + 2(0, 1) = (0, 0) + (3, 0) + (0, 2) = (3, 2)`. This is incorrect.

**Problem**
In order to improve her marks, Farzana undertook project work and succeeded in increasing her marks. Her marks became doubled for each exam. Choose the correct options.
* To obtain the marks obtained by Farzana after completion of the project, scalar multiplication has to be done by 2 to the row vector representing Farzana's marks.
* After completion of the project the row vector representing Farzana's marks is (76, 42, 70).

#### **Correct Options**
* To obtain the marks obtained by Farzana after completion of the project, scalar multiplication has to be done by 2 to the row vector representing Farzana's marks.
* After completion of the project the row vector representing Farzana's marks is (76, 42, 70).

#### **Explanation**
* Farzana's initial marks vector is `F = [38, 21, 35]`.
* Doubling her marks means performing a **scalar multiplication by 2**.
* The new marks vector is `2 * F = 2 * [38, 21, 35] = [76, 42, 70]`.

***

### Question 5: Vector Addition

**Problem**
Following Farzana's improved marks (doubled for each exam), all students were given bonus marks in Quiz 2, given by the column vector `[10, 12, 15]·µÄ`. What will be the column vector representing the final marks obtained in Quiz 2 by Karthika, Romy and Farzana?

#### **Correct Option**
* `[60, 53, 57]·µÄ`

#### **Explanation**
1.  **Initial Quiz 2 Marks:** The column vector for original Quiz 2 marks is `Q‚ÇÇ_initial = [50, 41, 21]·µÄ`.
2.  **Farzana's Improvement:** Farzana's Quiz 2 mark is doubled: `21 * 2 = 42`. The marks vector before the bonus is `Q‚ÇÇ_improved = [50, 41, 42]·µÄ`.
3.  **Add Bonus Marks:** Add the bonus vector to the improved marks vector.
    `Final Marks = Q‚ÇÇ_improved + Bonus`
    `= [50, 41, 42]·µÄ + [10, 12, 15]·µÄ`
    `= [50+10, 41+12, 42+15]·µÄ = [60, 53, 57]·µÄ`.

### Question 6: Vector Identities

**Problem**
Let A and B be two vectors. Which of the following statements is (are) true?
* `3A + 5B = 3(A + B) + [(A + B) - (A - B)]`
* `3A + 5B = 5(A + B) - [(A + B) - (A - B)]`
* `3A + 5B = 3(A + B) + [(A + B) + (A - B)]`
* `3A + 5B = 5(A + B) - [(A + B) + (A - B)]`

***

#### **Correct Options**
* `3A + 5B = 3(A + B) + [(A + B) - (A - B)]`
* `3A + 5B = 5(A + B) - [(A + B) + (A - B)]`

#### **Concepts Explained üí°**
To verify vector identities, simplify the right-hand side (RHS) using basic vector algebra and check if it equals the left-hand side (LHS). Two helpful simplifications are:
* `(A + B) + (A - B) = 2A`
* `(A + B) - (A - B) = 2B`

#### **Step-by-Step Solution**
* **Option 1:**
    RHS = `3(A + B) + [2B] = 3A + 3B + 2B = 3A + 5B`. This matches the LHS. **Correct.**
* **Option 2:**
    RHS = `5(A + B) - [2B] = 5A + 5B - 2B = 5A + 3B`. This does not match. Incorrect.
* **Option 3:**
    RHS = `3(A + B) + [2A] = 3A + 3B + 2A = 5A + 3B`. This does not match. Incorrect.
* **Option 4:**
    RHS = `5(A + B) - [2A] = 5A + 5B - 2A = 3A + 5B`. This matches the LHS. **Correct.**

### Question 7: Standard Basis Vectors

**Problem**
Let `V‚ÇÅ = (1, 0, 0)`, `V‚ÇÇ = (0, 1, 0)` and `V‚ÇÉ = (0, 0, 1)` be three vectors and `a, b, c` be three real numbers (scalars). Which of the following is (are) true?
* `(a, b, c) = aV‚ÇÅ + bV‚ÇÇ + cV‚ÇÉ`
* `(a, b, c) = abV‚ÇÅ + bcV‚ÇÇ + caV‚ÇÉ`
* `(a, 0, c) = aV‚ÇÅ + cV‚ÇÇ + 0V‚ÇÉ`
* `(a, 0, c) = aV‚ÇÅ + 0V‚ÇÇ + cV‚ÇÉ`

***

#### **Correct Options**
* `(a, b, c) = aV‚ÇÅ + bV‚ÇÇ + cV‚ÇÉ`
* `(a, 0, c) = aV‚ÇÅ + 0V‚ÇÇ + cV‚ÇÉ`

#### **Concepts Explained üí°**
The vectors `V‚ÇÅ`, `V‚ÇÇ`, and `V‚ÇÉ` are the **standard basis vectors** in 3D space, often denoted as `√Æ`, `ƒµ`, and `kÃÇ`. Any vector `(x, y, z)` can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination `xV‚ÇÅ + yV‚ÇÇ + zV‚ÇÉ`.

#### **Step-by-Step Solution**
* **Option 1:** `aV‚ÇÅ + bV‚ÇÇ + cV‚ÇÉ = a(1,0,0) + b(0,1,0) + c(0,0,1) = (a,0,0) + (0,b,0) + (0,0,c) = (a,b,c)`. **Correct.**
* **Option 2:** `abV‚ÇÅ + bcV‚ÇÇ + caV‚ÇÉ = (ab, bc, ca)`. This is not equal to `(a,b,c)`. Incorrect.
* **Option 3:** `aV‚ÇÅ + cV‚ÇÇ + 0V‚ÇÉ = a(1,0,0) + c(0,1,0) = (a, c, 0)`. This is not equal to `(a,0,c)`. Incorrect.
* **Option 4:** `aV‚ÇÅ + 0V‚ÇÇ + cV‚ÇÉ = a(1,0,0) + 0 + c(0,0,1) = (a, 0, c)`. **Correct.**

### Question 8: Geometric Interpretation of Vectors

**Problem**
Consider vectors `A(-1, 2)` and `B(2, -2)`. Choose the set of correct options based on the figure.

#### **Correct Options**
* `v‚ÇÅ` represents a scalar multiple of A.
* `v‚ÇÇ` represents a scalar multiple of A.
* `v‚ÇÖ` represents a scalar multiple of B.
* `v‚ÇÑ` represents a scalar multiple of A + B.

#### **Concepts Explained üí°**
* **Scalar Multiple:** The vector `k * A` is a scalar multiple of `A`. Geometrically, it lies on the same line as `A` (passing through the origin). If `k > 0`, it's in the same direction; if `k < 0`, it's in the opposite direction.
* **Vector Addition:** The vector `A + B` is found by adding the components. Geometrically, it is the diagonal of the parallelogram formed by vectors A and B.

#### **Step-by-Step Solution**
1.  **Analyze Scalar Multiples of A:** Vector `A = (-1, 2)` is in the second quadrant. Any scalar multiple of A must lie on the line passing through the origin and `(-1, 2)`. Both `v‚ÇÅ` and `v‚ÇÇ` lie on this line.
2.  **Analyze Scalar Multiples of B:** Vector `B = (2, -2)` is in the fourth quadrant. Any scalar multiple of B must lie on the line passing through the origin and `(2, -2)`. Vector `v‚ÇÖ` lies on this line.
3.  **Analyze A + B:** `A + B = (-1, 2) + (2, -2) = (1, 0)`. This is a vector pointing along the positive x-axis. Any scalar multiple of `A + B` must lie on the x-axis. Vector `v‚ÇÑ` lies on the positive x-axis.

### Question 9 & 10: Solving a Vector Equation

**Problem**
Let `A = (1, 1, 1)` and `B = (2, -1, 4)` be two vectors. Suppose `c.A + 3B = (4, j, k)`, where `c, j, k` are real numbers (scalars).
**9) Find the value of c.**
**10) Find the value of j + k.**

***

#### **Answers**
* **9) c = -2**
* **10) j + k = 5**

#### **Concepts Explained üí°**
To solve a vector equation, perform the scalar multiplication and vector addition on one side. Then, equate the corresponding components of the vectors on both sides of the equation to form a system of simple equations.

#### **Step-by-Step Solution**
1.  **Set up the equation:**
    `c * (1, 1, 1) + 3 * (2, -1, 4) = (4, j, k)`

2.  **Perform the operations on the left side:**
    `(c, c, c) + (6, -3, 12) = (4, j, k)`
    `(c + 6, c - 3, c + 12) = (4, j, k)`

3.  **Equate components to find c (for Question 9):**
    The first components must be equal:
    `c + 6 = 4`
    `c = 4 - 6 = -2`

4.  **Use c to find j and k (for Question 10):**
    * Equate the second components: `j = c - 3 = -2 - 3 = -5`
    * Equate the third components: `k = c + 12 = -2 + 12 = 10`

5.  **Calculate j + k:**
    `j + k = -5 + 10 = 5`
