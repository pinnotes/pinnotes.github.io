Building on our previous chat, let's dive deeper into strings! 🥳

### What are Strings? A Quick Recap!

As we discussed, **strings are Python's way of handling text** 📝. Imagine them as an ordered line of characters – like letters, numbers, or symbols. They are fundamental for anything involving words or sentences. Python doesn't have a separate type for individual characters; instead, a single character is simply a string of length one.

### How to Create Strings (and more ways!) 🛠️

You already know about single and double quotes, like `'hello'` or `"world"`. Python considers these identical.

Here are some more advanced ways and details:

*   **Triple Quotes (`'''` or `"""`)**: These are super useful for strings that need to span multiple lines. Python collects all the text, including newlines, into a single string. They're also often used for **documentation strings (docstrings)**, which explain what your code does.
    *   Example:
        ```python
        multi_line_message = """This is a string
        that spans
        multiple lines!"""
        print(multi_line_message)
        ```
*   **Escape Characters (`\`)**: Sometimes you need to include special characters that Python might otherwise interpret differently. Escape characters, like `\n` for a newline or `\t` for a tab, allow you to do this. If you want to include a quote character within a string that's defined with the same type of quote, you'd escape it (e.g., `'It\'s a beautiful day'`).
    *   Example:
        ```python
        special_text = "Hello\n\tWorld!" # \n is newline, \t is tab
        print(special_text)
        ```
*   **Raw Strings (`r"..."`)**: If your string contains many backslashes that you don't want Python to interpret as escape characters (e.g., file paths on Windows), you can use a raw string by putting an `r` before the opening quote.
    *   Example: `path = r"C:\new\folder\file.txt"`

### Basic String Operations (Revisited) ✨

*   **Concatenation (`+`)**: This joins two or more strings together to form a brand **new string**.
    *   **Crucial Note**: Python **does not allow** you to mix numbers and strings directly with `+`. If you want to combine a number with a string, you must first convert the number to a string using `str()`.
        *   `"Age: " + str(30)` would result in `"Age: 30"`.
*   **Repetition (`*`)**: This creates a **new string** by repeating the original string a specified number of times.
    *   `"Go! " * 3` gives `"Go! Go! Go! "`.
*   **Length (`len()`)**: The `len()` function tells you how many characters are in a string.
    *   `len("Python")` is `6`.
*   **Membership (`in`)**: You can check if a character or a substring exists within a string using the `in` operator, which returns `True` or `False`.
    *   `'p' in 'apple'` would be `True`.

### Accessing Characters (Indexing) 🎯

Strings are ordered collections, so each character has a specific position, or **index**.

*   **Positive Indexing**: Starts from `0` for the very first character.
    *   `S = "Coffee"`
    *   `S` is `'C'`
    *   `S` is `'f'`
*   **Negative Indexing**: Starts from `-1` for the *last* character, then `-2` for the second to last, and so on. This is handy when you want to access characters from the end without knowing the string's exact length.
    *   `S[-1]` is `'e'`
    *   `S[-2]` is `'e'`
    *   Accessing an index that doesn't exist will cause an `IndexError`.

### Extracting Parts of Strings (Slicing) ✂️

**Slicing** lets you grab a part of a string, called a **substring**, by specifying a `start` and `end` index `[start:end]`.

*   The slice includes characters from `start` **up to, but not including**, `end`.
*   If `start` is omitted, it defaults to `0` (the beginning).
*   If `end` is omitted, it defaults to the end of the string.
*   `S = "Programming"`
    *   `S[0:4]` gives `"Prog"` (characters at index 0, 1, 2, 3).
    *   `S[7:]` gives `"ming"` (from index 7 to the end).
    *   `S[:3]` gives `"Pro"` (from the beginning up to index 3).
    *   `S[:]` creates a copy of the entire string.
*   **Step Size (`[start:end:step]`)**: You can add a third number, the `step`, to skip characters.
    *   `S[::2]` would take every second character (`"Pormig"`).
    *   `S[::-1]` is a common trick to **reverse a string** (`"gnimmargorP"`).

### Strings are Immutable 🧱

This is a **key concept**: strings in Python are **immutable**. Once a string is created, **you cannot change its characters directly**.

*   If you try `my_string = 'J'`, Python will raise a `TypeError`.
*   Instead, any operation that seems to "change" a string (like concatenation or methods like `replace()`) actually creates a **brand new string**. You then typically assign this new string back to a variable if you want to use the "changed" version.
    *   To change `"Hello"` to `"Jello"`, you'd do `'J' + "Hello"[1:]` to create a new string `"Jello"`.

### Useful String Methods 🛠️ (The power tools!)

Python's strings come with many built-in **methods** (functions that perform actions on the string itself). These methods return **new strings** with the desired modifications.

*   `.upper()` / `.lower()`: Convert all characters to uppercase or lowercase.
    *   `"Hello".upper()` returns `"HELLO"`.
*   `.find(substring)`: Returns the lowest index of the first occurrence of the `substring`, or `-1` if not found.
    *   `"banana".find("an")` returns `1`.
*   `.replace(old, new)`: Returns a new string with all occurrences of `old` replaced by `new`.
    *   `"apple".replace("p", "x")` returns `"axxle"`.
*   `.split(delimiter)`: Splits the string into a `list` of substrings based on a `delimiter` (e.g., a space or comma).
    *   `"one,two,three".split(',')` returns `['one', 'two', 'three']`.
*   `.join(iterable)`: This is the reverse of `split()`. It concatenates elements of an iterable (like a list) into a single string, using the string the method is called on as the separator.
    *   `"-".join(["apple", "banana", "cherry"])` returns `"apple-banana-cherry"`.
*   `.strip()`: Removes leading and trailing whitespace (or other specified characters).
    *   `"   Hello World   ".strip()` returns `"Hello World"`.
*   `.startswith(prefix)` / `.endswith(suffix)`: Checks if the string begins or ends with a specific `prefix` or `suffix`, returning `True` or `False`.

**How to find more methods?** 🤔 You can use the built-in `dir()` and `help()` functions:
*   `dir("")` will list all available methods and attributes for string objects.
*   `help("".method_name)` (e.g., `help("".replace)`) will give you a detailed description of what that specific method does, including its arguments and what it returns.

### Formatted Printing (f-strings & `.format()`) 🎨

To create strings with dynamic content (like variables), Python offers handy formatting tools.

*   **f-strings (Formatted String Literals)**: This is the most modern and recommended way. You put an `f` before the opening quote, and then embed variable names or expressions directly inside curly braces `{}` within the string.
    *   `name = "Alice"`
    *   `age = 30`
    *   `print(f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}!")` outputs `Name: Alice, Age: 30!`
*   **`.format()` Method**: A slightly older but still widely used method. You use curly braces `{}` as placeholders in the string, and then call `.format()` on the string, passing the values in order or by keyword.
    *   `"Name: {}, Age: {}!".format("Bob", 25)` outputs `Name: Bob, Age: 25!`

### Practice Questions (with answers below!) 🤔

1.  **Creating and Printing**:
    *   Create a single string variable `quote` that holds the following phrase: `She said, "It's a wonderful world!"` using the appropriate quote types and escape characters.
    *   Print the `quote` variable.
    *   What would `len(quote)` return?

2.  **Combination & Repetition**:
    *   Given `part1 = "Python"` and `part2 = "Rocks!"`, create a new string `message` by concatenating `part1` with a space, then `part2`, and finally repeating `part2` two more times.
    *   Print `message`.

3.  **Advanced Slicing**:
    *   Given `word = "Unbelievable"`, use slicing to extract:
        *   The first three characters.
        *   The last two characters using negative indexing.
        *   Every other character starting from the beginning.
        *   The word reversed.

4.  **Immutability in Action**:
    *   Suppose `original_string = "apple pie"`. You want to change it to `"apricot pie"`. Can you do `original_string = 'r'`? Explain why or why not.
    *   How would you correctly achieve the desired change (`"apricot pie"`) by creating a *new* string?

5.  **String Methods**:
    *   Given `data = "   Item1,  Item2 , Item3   "`, use string methods to:
        *   Remove all leading and trailing whitespace.
        *   Then, split the resulting string into a list of individual items.
        *   Print the final list. (Hint: you might need to strip whitespace from individual items too!).

6.  **Formatted Printing (f-string)**:
    *   You have `item_name = "Laptop"` and `price = 1200.50`.
    *   Use an f-string to print a message like: `The Laptop costs £1200.50.`
    *   Then, modify the f-string to display the price with only two decimal places.

### Answers to Practice Questions ✅

1.  **Creating and Printing**:
    *   `quote = "She said, \"It's a wonderful world!\""`
    *   `print(quote)` will output: `She said, "It's a wonderful world!"`
    *   `len(quote)` would return **28**. (S-1, h-2, e-3, (space)-4, s-5, a-6, i-7, d-8, ,-9, (space)-10, "-11, I-12, t-13, '-14, s-15, (space)-16, a-17, (space)-18, w-19, o-20, n-21, d-22, e-23, r-24, f-25, u-26, l-27, (space)-28, w-29, o-30, r-31, l-32, d-33, !-34, "-35. Wait, let me recount the example: `She said, "It's a wonderful world!"` (S,h,e, ,s,a,i,d,,, ," ,I,t,',s, ,a, ,w,o,n,d,e,r,f,u,l, ,w,o,r,l,d,!,") => 35 characters. The `\` used in the code `\"` represents a single character when stored in the string.
    *   Correct length for `quote = "She said, \"It's a wonderful world!\""` is 35.

2.  **Combination & Repetition**:
    *   `part1 = "Python"`
    *   `part2 = "Rocks!"`
    *   `message = part1 + " " + part2 + part2 * 2`
    *   `print(message)` will output: `Python Rocks!Rocks!Rocks!`

3.  **Advanced Slicing**:
    *   `word = "Unbelievable"`
    *   First three characters: `word[0:3]` or `word[:3]` returns `"Unb"`.
    *   Last two characters: `word[-2:]` returns `"le"`.
    *   Every other character: `word[::2]` returns `"Ubelae"`.
    *   Reversed word: `word[::-1]` returns `"elbailebnU"`.

4.  **Immutability in Action**:
    *   No, you **cannot** do `original_string = 'r'` because strings are **immutable** in Python. Once `"apple pie"` is created, its individual characters cannot be changed directly in place.
    *   To correctly achieve `"apricot pie"`, you would create a new string using slicing and concatenation:
        *   `new_string = original_string[:2] + "ricot" + original_string[5:]`
        *   Alternatively, using `replace`: `new_string = original_string.replace("apple", "apricot")` (though this might be too broad if "apple" appears elsewhere).

5.  **String Methods**:
    *   `data = "   Item1,  Item2 , Item3   "`
    *   ```python
        stripped_data = data.strip()
        items_list = stripped_data.split(',')
        final_items = [item.strip() for item in items_list]
        print(final_items)
        ```
    *   Output: `['Item1', 'Item2', 'Item3']`

6.  **Formatted Printing (f-string)**:
    *   `item_name = "Laptop"`
    *   `price = 1200.50`
    *   Message 1: `print(f"The {item_name} costs £{price}.")` outputs `The Laptop costs £1200.5.`
    *   Message 2 (price with two decimal places): `print(f"The {item_name} costs £{price:.2f}.")` outputs `The Laptop costs £1200.50.`.
