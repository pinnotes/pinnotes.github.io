**Replit** is an online integrated development environment (IDE) or portal used for coding. It provides a graphical user interface for Python development. One of its key advantages is that you do not have to install anything before starting to code, thanks to the internet. Replit binds together various development tasks into a single view.

To start using Replit, you can open your browser and go to **Replit.com**. After seeing the main page, you click on **"Start coding"**. You may be asked for a username and password, but if you have a Gmail ID, you can typically click the 'G' icon to log in using your Gmail account.

Once logged in, you'll see a screen or window. To create a new Python program, you go to the **plus symbol** and click on it. You then select **Python** as the language you want to code in. The system will provide a machine-given name for your project, often a random combination of words, which you can change. You then click on **"create REPL"**. A REPL (repository) gets created; it's simply a place where you can come and code.

In Replit, you can type your code. For instance, you can type `print hello`. The features are often described as self-explanatory. To run the code you've typed, you come to the run button and click on it, and you will see the output in the console.

Replit organises various features which are accessible through icons on the left side panel. The first icon is for **files**, which allows you to see the files and folders in your project. You can add new files and folders using the options provided. Replit allows you to create multiple programs and organise them systematically using files and folders. Creating a file in Replit is also mentioned in the context of file handling.

Beyond basic coding and file management, Replit has many other features, including version control, packages, secrets, settings, databases, and unit tests. Within the settings, you can change the layout, for example, from the default side-by-side view to a stacked view, which places the coding area at the top and the console output below.

Replit also provides **built-in help** for commands like `print`, offering detailed information when you use the help feature. The sources note that integrated development environments (IDEs) like Replit automatically handle indentation.

While Replit offers many features for development, one source notes that it can sometimes take some time to display results. The goal is to provide you with enough features for starting with Python programming.
