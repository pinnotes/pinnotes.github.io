Based on the sources and our conversation history, the "Interesting Cipher" discussed is the **Caesar Cipher**. It is presented as a simple form of secrecy or encryption.

Here's a breakdown of the cipher and how it's approached using Python in the video:

1.  **The Concept**: The Caesar Cipher involves "**rotating**" or shifting each letter in a message by a fixed number of places in the alphabet. The key is the number of places the letters are shifted. If a shift goes beyond the end of the alphabet (e.g., shifting 'Z' by 1), it **wraps around** to the beginning. For instance, 'A' rotated by 3 is 'D', and 'Z' rotated by 1 is 'A'. Rotating a word means rotating each letter by the same amount.

2.  **Goal in the Video**: The specific task demonstrated is shifting a string, like the name "sudarshan", by **one letter** to produce "tvebstibo". This is a Caesar Cipher with a shift of 1.

3.  **Python Implementation Approach**:
    *   An alphabet string, called `alpha`, is used to represent all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.
    *   To shift a letter, its **index** within the alphabet string `alpha` is found. The built-in string function `index` is mentioned for this purpose.
    *   The shift is applied to this index (e.g., adding 1 for a one-letter shift).
    *   To handle wrapping around the alphabet, the **modulo operator (%)** with 26 (the number of letters) is used on the shifted index. This ensures the resulting index stays within the range 0-25. For example, 25 modulo 26 is 25, which corresponds to 'z', and if the shifted index was 26, 26 modulo 26 is 0, corresponding to 'a'.
    *   The character at this new, calculated index in the `alpha` string is the shifted letter.
    *   A new string (e.g., `t`) is built by appending or **concatenating** these shifted letters one by one. String concatenation can be done using the `+` operator.
    *   The process involves iterating through the original string, letter by letter, performing the shift for each, and adding the result to the new string. The video notes that automating this repetitive process with code will be discussed later.

4.  **Purpose (Simple Secrecy)**: The Caesar Cipher is described as a method in **cryptography**. If you shift a message by a particular amount `k`, you can use `k` as a key and tell someone that they need to shift back by `k` units to understand the original text. It's presented as a basic, "very, very naivest form" of encoding text so that nobody understands it, considered a "toy example".

5.  **Related Concepts Mentioned Elsewhere**:
    *   String indexing is a fundamental operation used to access individual characters or slices of a string by their position (offset). This includes negative indexing, where negative numbers count from the end of the string.
    *   String slicing is used to extract segments of a string. A slice like `S[i:j]` includes characters from index `i` up to, but not including, index `j`.
    *   The concept of converting characters to numeric codes (`ord`) and numeric codes back to characters (`chr`) is also mentioned in the context of rotating letters in the alphabet. `ord('c') - ord('a')` gives the position relative to 'a'.

This specific application of string manipulation (shifting letters using indexing, modulo, and concatenation) is a clear demonstration of how basic Python string operations can be used for simple tasks like encoding.
