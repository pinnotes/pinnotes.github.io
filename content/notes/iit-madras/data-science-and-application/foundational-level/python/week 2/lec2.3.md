Based on the sources, here is an explanation of dynamic typing in Python, building upon the concept of variables:

Python's approach to variables is closely tied to a fundamental concept called **dynamic typing**. Unlike some other programming languages, Python does not require you to declare the type of a variable before you use it.

Here's how it works from a programmer's perspective:

1.  **Variables are Names, Objects Have Types**:
    *   In Python, **data takes the form of objects**. Objects are essentially pieces of memory that hold values and have associated operations.
    *   A **variable is simply a name that refers to, or links to, a value (an object)**. You can think of it as an entry in a system table with a space for a link to an object.
    *   The **notion of type lives with objects, not names**. Each object contains a header field that tags it with its type, such as integer, string, or list. Variables themselves have no type information or constraints associated with them.

2.  **Dynamic Typing in Action**:
    *   When you assign a value to a variable using the assignment statement (`=`), the variable is created (if it doesn't exist) and linked to the object representing that value.
    *   Because the variable name is just a generic reference, you can **reassign it to refer to an object of a completely different type** at a later point in your code. For example, a variable `a` can first refer to an integer object `10` and later be reassigned to refer to a string object `'India'`.
    *   When a variable appears in an expression, it is immediately replaced with the object it currently refers to. Python then performs operations based on the type of the *object*, not the variable name.
    *   This is what dynamic typing means: the type of the object a variable refers to can **change dynamically** during the execution of your program. For instance, even a division operation can cause Python to change a variable's type from integer to float automatically to be "on the safer side" for potential future calculations.

3.  **Variable Creation and Assignment Details**:
    *   Variables are **created when your code first assigns them a value**.
    *   All variables **must be explicitly assigned before they can be used**; attempting to reference an unassigned variable will result in errors.
    *   Conceptually, when an assignment like `a = 3` occurs, Python performs steps such as creating an object for `3`, creating the variable `a` (if needed), and linking `a` to the object `3`. These links are called references.
    *   When a variable is reassigned to a *new* object, the link to the *prior* object is discarded. The space held by the prior object may be reclaimed if it is no longer referenced by any other names or objects. This process is known as garbage collection.
    *   Multiple variables can refer to the same object (shared references).

4.  **Implications of Dynamic Typing**:
    *   **Flexibility and Conciseness:** Dynamic typing means less code is required because you don't write type declaration statements. Variables are generic and can reference any type of object.
    *   **Polymorphism:** This dynamic nature is the root of Python's polymorphism. An operation or a function can often work on many different types of objects automatically, as long as those objects support the required "interface" (the set of operations). You code to object interfaces rather than specific types.
    *   **Runtime Type Errors:** While flexible, type errors are typically detected at runtime when an operation is attempted on an object that does not support it, rather than during a compile step.

In summary, dynamic typing in Python means that variable names themselves don't have fixed types; instead, they dynamically refer to objects which carry their type information. This model provides significant flexibility and is a core principle behind Python's conciseness and the power of polymorphism.
