üìù **Adverbs - A Quick Review**

Adverbs are powerful words or groups of words that **modify (or give additional information about)** verbs, adjectives, and even other adverbs. They help describe *when*, *where*, *how*, or *to what extent* an action is performed, or they indicate the quality or degree of an action.

For example:
*   "Shelley is **always** ready for help." (modifies an adjective)
*   "He loved her **very much**." (modifies a verb)
*   "Time is running out **fast**." (modifies a verb)
*   "I gave that **willingly**." (modifies a verb)

üí° **Adverb Clauses and Phrases**
Beyond single words, groups of words can also act as adverbs:
*   **Adverb Clauses**: These are complete clauses that modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs in a sentence.
    *   Example: "He carried the load **until he was tired**." (modifies "carried")
*   **Adverb Phrases**: These are phrases (groups of words without a subject and verb) that modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs.
    *   Example: "Maya arrived, **carrying her suitcases with two hands**." (modifies "arrived")
    *   Example: "You are irritated **without any reason**." (modifies "irritated")
