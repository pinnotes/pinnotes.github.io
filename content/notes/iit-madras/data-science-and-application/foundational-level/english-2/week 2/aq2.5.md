#### State whether the following sentence  is grammatically right.


1. Degree adverbs are used in front of prepositions.

True

False
{{< border type="tip" title="Solution" >}}
Based on the information provided in the sources and our conversation history:

The statement "Degree adverbs are used in front of prepositions" is **False**, according to the sources.

Here's why:

*   Sources define degree adverbs as words or sets of words that give information about the extent or degree of something.
*   Degree adverbs are explicitly stated to be used **before adjectives, verbs or other adverbs** to provide this information. Examples are given like "extremely sad" (before an adjective), "really hate" (before a verb), and "almost always" (before another adverb).
*   The sources discuss the position of degree adverbs relative to adjectives, verbs, and other adverbs. Source also mentions a "unique ordering" for 'quite' and 'rather' when they precede an adjective and a noun (e.g., "quite a challenging task" from our conversation, or "a rather painful decision" mentioned in a previous evaluation, although source specifically shows "a fairy cold day", "a very cold day" etc. with the article first, and notes 'quite, rather' as unique).
*   While prepositions are discussed extensively in the sources, and prepositional phrases are noted as sometimes functioning adverbially or adjectivally, the sources *do not* state that degree adverbs modify prepositions themselves or are placed directly in front of prepositions in a modifying role.
*   The examples provided of degree adverbs and what they modify do not include prepositions.

Therefore, based on the categories of words that degree adverbs are said to modify (adjectives, verbs, other adverbs), and the absence of any mention or example of degree adverbs modifying prepositions, the statement is not supported by the provided material.

2. Degree adverbs give information about the extent or degree of something.

True

False
{{< border type="tip" title="Solution" >}}
Based on the information found in the sources, the statement **"Degree adverbs give information about the extent or degree of something"** is **True**.

Here's the supporting evidence from the sources:

*   Source explicitly states: "**degree adverbs are used before adjectives, verbs or other adverbs to give information about the extent or degree of something**."
*   Adverbs of degree are listed as a category of adverbs.
*   Source explains that "adverbs of degree explain or indicate or express the amount or the amount of force, which is being performed, how much?".
*   Source reinforces this by stating that "the degree of adverbs of degree tells us how much, how often".
*   Source defines "adverbs that expresses the importance degree or level of action in the sentences are called adverbs of degree".

These definitions and descriptions directly support the idea that degree adverbs are used to convey information about the extent or degree of something.

3. The word ‘quiet’ is a degree adverb.

True

False
{{< border type="tip" title="Solution" >}}
Based on the information in the sources and our conversation history, the statement "The word ‘quiet’ is a degree adverb" is **False**.

Here's why:

1.  The sources define **degree adverbs** as words used before adjectives, verbs, or other adverbs to give information about the **extent or degree of something**. Common degree adverbs are listed and discussed, such as 'extremely', 'really', 'almost', 'completely', 'fair', 'rather', 'slightly', 'too', 'totally', 'very much', and 'very'.
2.  The word **'quite'** (spelled q-u-i-t-e) is explicitly listed as a degree adverb in the sources. Its use and two different meanings are discussed in detail, showing it modifies adjectives or other adverbs to indicate degree. We also discussed 'quite' modifying the adjective 'challenging' in our previous conversation ("That is quite a challenging task").
3.  However, the word **'quiet'** (spelled q-u-i-e-t), which sounds similar to 'quite', functions differently according to the sources.
4.  The sources show examples where **'quiet' is used as an adjective**, typically describing a noun or following a linking verb like 'be' or 'is'. For instance, the sentence "Sue is very **quiet**" uses 'quiet' as an adjective describing 'Sue'. Another example is "Please be **quiet**", where 'quiet' describes the desired state of the subject (you).
5.  The source explains that adverbs are often formed by adding the suffix '-ly' to adjectives. It lists **'quietly'** as the adverbial form derived from the adjective 'quiet', indicating how something happens (e.g., "Sue speaks very quietly").
6.  Therefore, based on the definitions, examples, and classifications provided, 'quiet' is presented as an adjective, while 'quite' is identified as a degree adverb. The statement that 'quiet' is a degree adverb is not supported by the sources.

4. There is no difference between the words ‘very’ and ‘too’.

True

False
{{< border type="tip" title="Solution" >}}
Based on the information in the sources and our conversation history, the statement "There is no difference between the words ‘very’ and ‘too’" is **False**.

Here's a breakdown of why, according to the sources:

*   Both 'very' and 'too' are classified as degree adverbs. They are used to give information about the extent or degree of something.
*   The sources explicitly state that 'very' and 'too' are **two degree adverbs that are often mixed up in sentences and are sometimes used interchangeably**.
*   However, the sources go on to explain that while they *can* be used interchangeably in "a lot of context", particularly in informal spoken English and negative sentences where 'too' can mean roughly the same as 'very', there are distinct meanings and **accurate uses** for each word.
*   **'Very' is used before an adjective or adverb to refer to a high degree**. For example, "The weather is **very** hot in Chennai".
*   **'Too' is used when you mean more than enough, or more than what is wanted or needed**. This often implies a negative consequence or an undesirable level. The sources state that **'too' has a higher degree than that of 'very'**. An example given is "It is **too** hot to stay in this room", implying the heat is unbearable.
*   The sources note that while "The weather was **too** hot in Chennai, it is perfect for swimming" is grammatically right, using 'very' in this sentence would sound better or be more accurate because 'too' implies an excessive, unwanted degree. Conversely, in "It is **too** hot to stay in this room", 'too' is preferred because it specifically conveys the sense of unbearable heat.
*   Furthermore, 'too much' and 'too many' are used to mean **more than you want or more than is good**, distinguishing them from 'much' or 'many' used with 'very' or 'a lot'.

In summary, while there might be some overlap in informal usage, the sources clearly define different specific meanings and appropriate contexts for 'very' and 'too'. 'Very' indicates a high degree, whereas 'too' indicates an excessive or undesirable degree, often higher than 'very'. Therefore, the statement that there is *no* difference between them is incorrect.

5. We do not use the word ‘very’ before verbs.

True

False
{{< border type="tip" title="Solution" >}}
Based on the information in the sources, the statement **"We do not use the word ‘very’ before verbs"** is **True**.

Here's what the sources say:

*   Source initially states that degree adverbs are used before adjectives, verbs, or other adverbs.
*   However, when discussing the specific use of 'very' and 'very much', Source clarifies a more precise rule: "**we do not use very before verbs, but we can use very much before some verbs**".
*   Source reiterates this point, stating: "**we do not use very before verbs**".
*   An example provided is "**I very much agree with your decision**", which is presented as correct. In contrast, "**It is not right to use, I very agree with your decision**".
*   Source lists some specific verbs that allow 'very much' before them, including agree, doubt, fear, hope, like, want, admire, appreciate, enjoy, and regret. It explicitly states you can use 'very much' or 'much' before the last four verbs (admire, appreciate, enjoy, regret), **but not 'very'**.

Therefore, while degree adverbs in general *can* modify verbs, the specific rule for the word 'very', as stated in the sources, is that it is **not used directly before verbs**. Instead, 'very much' is used before certain verbs.
