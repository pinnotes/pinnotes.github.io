{{< border type="tip" title="Solution" >}}
Based on the information in the sources, Adverbs of manner answer the question of **How**.

The sources define adverbs of manner as a category of adverbs that provide information about **how** an action is performed. They are described as adding to or modifying the verb to indicate the **manner** in which the action is carried out. Examples given, such as "equally", "carefully", "slowly", and "fast", illustrate this by describing the manner of distribution, holding, improvement, and running, respectively.

The sources explicitly state:
*   "So, adverbs of manner... talks about **how** the action is being performed".
*   They "give us the information about the **manner** in which the action is being performed... that is a manner of, adverbs of manner, **how** the action is being performed".
*   "So, adverbs of manner add to the verb and indicate **how** the action is being performed, alright".

Therefore, based on the provided material, adverbs of manner tell us **how** an action happens.

Manner
{{< border type="tip" title="Solution" >}}
Based on the information in the sources, the word 'Sunday' can function as an adverb of **Time**.

The sources classify adverbs based on the questions they answer. Adverbs of time or frequency answer questions like "when the time and how often the frequency". Examples of words that function as adverbs of time or frequency include 'yesterday', 'always', 'occasionally', and specific days like 'Monday' or 'Sunday'. The sources explicitly state that words referring to a point of time or day, such as 'Sunday', act as an adverb of time or frequency in a sentence. They talk about the timing and frequency of the action.

In contrast, adverbs of degree answer the question of **how much**, indicating the extent or degree of something (e.g., 'completely', 'thoroughly', 'very', 'too'). Adverbs of manner answer the question of **how**, indicating the way an action is performed (e.g., 'equally', 'carefully', 'slowly', 'fast').

Therefore, since 'Sunday' refers to a specific day, indicating *when* an action occurs, it functions as an adverb of time according to the sources' classification.

Adverb of frequency

Conjunctive adverb

Adverb of direction
{{< border type="tip" title="Solution" >}}
Based on the information in the sources and our conversation history, the phrase 'in the east' in the sentence "The Sun rises in the east." functions as an adverb of **direction**.

The sources classify adverbs based on the questions they answer. Adverbs of place or direction are described as indicating "the place or direction of the action" and answering the question "**where** is the action being performed?" or "**in what direction**". Examples of such adverbs or adverbial phrases include 'in the park', 'in the field', and 'in the place'.

The phrase 'in the east' tells us *where* or *in what direction* the action of 'rising' is performed. Therefore, it fits the definition of an adverb of direction provided in the sources. The sources also note that prepositional phrases can have an adverbial function. 'In the east' is a prepositional phrase functioning adverbially.

Let's consider the other options presented:

*   **Adverb of frequency:** These answer the question "how often". 'In the east' does not indicate how often the sun rises.
*   **Sentence adverb:** These adverbs take the "entire sentence in its scope", often indicating the speaker's attitude. 'In the east' modifies only the verb 'rises', not the entire sentence.
*   **Conjunctive adverb:** These function as linkers, connecting clauses or phrases. 'In the east' does not connect clauses.

Therefore, based on the definition and examples provided in the sources, 'in the east' is an adverb of direction.

4. Identify the kind of adverbs used in the following sentence:
My cat is sleeping on the roof.

Adverb of frequency

Adverb of manner

Adverb of place

Adverb of degree
{{< border type="tip" title="Solution" >}}
Based on the information in the sources and our conversation history, the phrase 'on the roof' in the sentence "My cat is sleeping on the roof" is an adverb of **place**.

Here's why:

1.  **What adverbs of place (or direction) do:** According to the sources, adverbs of place or direction indicate "**the place or direction of the action**". They answer the question "**where** is the action being performed?" or "in what direction".
2.  **How 'on the roof' functions:** In the sentence "My cat is sleeping on the roof," the phrase 'on the roof' tells us the **location** or **place** where the cat is performing the action of sleeping. It answers the question "Where is my cat sleeping?".
3.  **Prepositional phrases as adverbs:** The sources note that phrases, including prepositional phrases, can function as adverbs, particularly as adjuncts, adding additional information about the verb. Examples of prepositional phrases functioning as adverbs of place/direction are given, such as 'in the park', 'in the field', 'in a bank', 'to college', and 'at a goddess'. The phrase 'on the roof' is a prepositional phrase serving this adverbial function by specifying the location.

Let's briefly look at why the other options are not applicable based on the sources:

*   **Adverb of frequency:** These answer the question "how often". 'On the roof' doesn't tell us how often the cat sleeps.
*   **Adverb of manner:** These answer the question "**how** the action is being performed". 'On the roof' doesn't describe *how* the cat is sleeping (e.g., quietly, peacefully).
*   **Adverb of degree:** These answer the question "**how much**". 'On the roof' doesn't indicate the extent or degree of the sleeping action.

Therefore, the phrase 'on the roof', by indicating the location of the action, functions as an adverb of place.

5. Identify the kind of adverbs used in the following sentence:
 I ate quickly.

Adverb of frequency

Adverb of manner

Adverb of place

Adverb of degree
{{< border type="tip" title="Solution" >}}
Based on the information in the sources, the adverb used in the sentence "I ate quickly" is an adverb of **manner**.

Here's why:

*   Adverbs of manner tell you **how** something happens or **how** somebody does something. They add to or modify the verb and indicate the **manner** in which the action is being performed.
*   They answer the question "**how**".
*   The word "**quickly**" is explicitly listed as an example of an adverb of manner.
*   Source uses the sentence "He ate his dinner very **quickly**" as an example to illustrate how adverbs of manner function.
*   The word "quickly" in your sentence "I ate quickly" modifies the verb "ate" and describes the **manner** in which the eating was done, answering the question "**How** did I eat?".

In contrast, the other options are not supported by the function of "quickly" as described in the sources:

*   **Adverb of frequency:** These answer the question "**how often**". "Quickly" does not indicate the frequency of eating.
*   **Adverb of place:** These indicate the place or direction of the action and answer the question "**where**" or "in what direction". "Quickly" does not indicate a location.
*   **Adverb of degree:** These indicate the extent or degree of something and answer the question "**how much**". "Quickly" describes the speed or manner of eating, not the degree or extent of the action itself.

Therefore, the word "quickly" in "I ate quickly" is an adverb of **manner** because it describes *how* the eating occurred.
