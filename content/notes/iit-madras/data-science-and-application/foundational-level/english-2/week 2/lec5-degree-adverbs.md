📝 **Important Concepts in English Adjectives: Degree Adverbs**

Degree adverbs are special words that help us explain **how much** or **to what extent** something is true. They give us more information about the **intensity** of adjectives, verbs, or other adverbs. Think of them as volume controls for your descriptions! 🔊

### 1. What are Degree Adverbs? 🤔

*   **Definition:** Degree adverbs are words or sets of words that **modify verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs** to give information about the **extent or degree of something**.
*   **Function:** They answer the question "how much?".
*   **Examples:** Some common degree adverbs include **completely, fairly, quite, rather, slightly, too, totally, very much, very, extremely, absolutely, nearly, entirely, less, mildly, most, thoroughly, somewhat, excessively, much**.

### 2. Gradable vs. Non-Gradable Adjectives 📈🛑

Adjectives can be categorised based on whether their quality can be measured in degrees:

*   **Gradable Adjectives:** These adjectives describe qualities that can have **different levels or intensities**. You can make them weaker or stronger.
    *   **Common Modifiers:** We use adverbs like **'very'** and **'extremely'** with gradable adjectives.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   "It is **very cold**." 🥶
        *   "It is **extremely cold**." ❄️
        *   "extremely **effective**"
        *   "extremely **difficult**"
        *   "hugely **entertaining**"
        *   "hugely **successful**"
*   **Non-Gradable Adjectives (Absolute Adjectives):** These adjectives express an **absolute quality** and cannot be made weaker or stronger. If something is "finished," it's finished; there are no degrees of "finished".
    *   **Common Modifiers:** We use adverbs like **'absolutely'** and **'completely'** with non-gradable adjectives. **'Simply'** also goes with non-gradable adjectives.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   "The project is **finished**." ✅ (You can't say "a bit finished" or "completely finished" in the sense of adding degree to an already absolute state).
        *   "absolutely **clear**"
        *   "absolutely **sure**"
        *   "simply **awful**"
        *   "simply **terrible**"

### 3. Special Usage of 'Very' and 'Too' 🤔

*   **'Very' for High Degree:** We use **'very'** before an adjective or adverb to refer to a **high degree**.
    *   Example: "The food was **very good**." 👍
*   **'Too' for More Than Enough:** We use **'too'** when we mean **more than enough**, or more than what is wanted or needed. It often implies a negative consequence.
    *   Example: "It is **too hot** to stay in this room." 🔥 (Implies it's unbearably hot)
*   **Informal Context:** In formal spoken English, especially in negative sentences, 'too' can sometimes mean roughly the same as 'very'.
    *   Example: "I am **not too bothered** about who fails." (Can also be "I am **not very bothered**")

### 4. Distinguishing 'Very' and 'Very Much' ⚠️

These two are often confused, but they have specific rules:

*   **'Very' with Verbs:** We **do not use 'very' directly before verbs**.
    *   ❌ "I **very agree** with your decision."
*   **'Very Much' with Verbs:** We **can use 'very much' before some verbs** to emphasize how we feel about things.
    *   **Common Verbs:** These include verbs like **agree, doubt, fear, hope, like, want, admire, appreciate, enjoy, regret**.
    *   Example: "I **very much agree** with your decision." ✅
    *   Example: "We **very much enjoyed** having you stay with us." 🎉
*   **'Very' with Participle Adjectives:** We use **'very' (but not 'very much') before participle adjectives** (adjectives usually ending in "-ing" or "-ed").
    *   Example: "I was **very disturbed** to hear the news." 😟
    *   Example: "It is **very disappointing**." 😔
*   **'Very Much' in Passive Voice:** We use **'very much' (but not 'very') before a past participle which is part of a passive voice construction**.
    *   Example: "The new highway **was very much needed**." 🛣️
    *   ❌ "The new highway was very needed."

### 5. The Curious Case of 'Quite' 🤔

The adverb 'quite' has **two different meanings** depending on how it's used:

*   **Meaning 1: "Fairly" or "A particular degree but not very"**.
    *   Example: "I was **quite satisfied** with the result." (Meaning: fairly satisfied)
*   **Meaning 2: "Completely" or "A large degree/A lot"**.
    *   This meaning is used when 'quite' modifies a **non-gradable (absolute) adjective**.
    *   Example: "You are **quite wrong**." (Meaning: completely wrong)
    *   Example: "Are you **quite sure**?" (Meaning: totally sure)

---

✅ **Answers**

1.  "The movie was **hugely successful**." 🎬
    *   **Degree Adverb:** `hugely`
    *   **Type of Adjective:** `successful` is a **gradable adjective**, indicating that there can be different levels of success (e.g., a little successful, very successful, hugely successful).
2.  a) I **very much** appreciate your help. 🙏
    *   **Explanation:** `Appreciate` is a verb that expresses feeling. According to the sources, we use `very much` (not `very`) before such verbs to emphasize feelings.
    b) The news was **very** shocking. 😱
    *   **Explanation:** `Shocking` is a participle adjective (ending in -ing). We use `very` (not `very much`) before participle adjectives.
3.  a) The water was **quite cold**.
    *   **Meaning:** Here, 'quite' means **"fairly"** or "a particular degree but not very". It suggests the water was moderately cold, but not extremely cold.
    b) The answer was **quite incorrect**.
    *   **Meaning:** Here, `incorrect` is a non-gradable (absolute) adjective. When 'quite' modifies a non-gradable adjective, it means **"completely"** or "totally". It implies the answer was 100% wrong.
