Based on the sources provided and our conversation history, here are some **important concepts in degree adverbs**:

*   **Definition and Function:**
    *   Degree adverbs are words, or sets of words, that **modify verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs**.
    *   They are used **before** adjectives, verbs, or other adverbs.
    *   They provide information about the **extent or degree of something**.
    *   They indicate the **quality of degree of the action**.
    *   They explain or indicate the **amount or the amount of force**.
    *   They **answer the question "how much?"**.
    *   Words like 'extremely', 'really', 'almost', 'completely', 'fairly', 'quite', 'rather', 'slightly', 'too', 'totally', 'very much', and 'very' are examples of degree adverbs. Other examples include 'nearly', 'entirely', 'less', 'mildly', 'most', 'thoroughly', 'somewhat', and 'excessively'.

*   **Examples of Use:**
    *   Modifying an adjective: "They are **extremely sad**". The word 'extremely' talks about the degree of sadness.
    *   Modifying a verb: "I **really hate** the smell of cigars". 'Really' expresses a greater degree of hatred. "Jessie **completely forgot** about her appointment". 'Completely' talks about the degree of forgetting.
    *   Modifying another adverb: "She is **almost always** late". 'Almost' modifies the adverb 'always'. "Maya runs **very fast**". 'Very' modifies the adverb 'fast'.
    *   In phrases: "a **very** cold day", "an **extremely** cold day", "a **moderately** cold day", "an **absolutely** cold day".

*   **Specific Usage Rules and Distinctions:**

    *   **Very vs. Too:**
        *   'Very' and 'too' are **degree adverbs that are often mixed up**.
        *   Use 'very' before an adjective or adverb to refer to a **high degree**.
        *   Use 'too' when you mean **more than enough, or more than what is wanted or needed**. 'Too' has a higher degree than 'very'.
        *   For example, "The weather is **very hot** in Chennai, it is perfect for swimming" is accurate for a pleasant high temperature.
        *   "It is **too hot** to stay in this room, let us find somewhere cooler" implies the heat is **unbearably hot** (more than wanted/needed).
        *   In formal spoken English, particularly in negative sentences, 'too' can sometimes mean roughly the same as 'very'.

    *   **Very vs. Very Much:**
        *   **Do not use 'very' before verbs**.
        *   You **can use 'very much' before some verbs** to emphasize how you feel about things. Examples of such verbs include agree, doubt, fear, hope, like, want, admire, appreciate, enjoy, and regret. For example, "I **very much agree** with your decision".
        *   However, 'very much' does not go with *all* verbs.
        *   You can use **'very', but not 'very much', before participle adjectives**. Participle adjectives usually end with "-ing" and "-ed". For instance, "I was **very disturbed** to hear the news" is correct, not "very much disturbed". Similarly, "It is **very disappointing**" is correct, not "very much disappointing".
        *   You can use **'very much' (or 'much'), but not 'very', before a past participle which is part of a passive structure**. For example, "The new highway was **very much needed**" is correct, not "very needed".

    *   **Gradable vs. Non-gradable Adjectives and Degree Adverbs:**
        *   This is an important distinction for using degree adverbs.
        *   **Gradable adjectives** are those where you can have **different levels of that quality**. You can make the word weaker or stronger with modifiers. Examples include 'cold' (**very cold**, **extremely cold**, **a bit cold**).
        *   **Non-gradable adjectives** describe qualities that are **absolute**. If something is finished, it's finished; there isn't "a bit finished" or "completely finished" in the sense of degree.
        *   Use **'extremely' and 'very' with gradable adjectives**. For instance, "**extremely effective**, **extremely difficult**, **extremely hard**". "**Hugely**" also goes with gradable adjectives, such as "**hugely entertaining**, **hugely successful**".
        *   Use **'absolutely' and 'completely' with non-gradable adjectives**. Examples include "**absolutely clear**, **absolutely sure**". "**Simply**" also goes with non-gradable adjectives, like "**simply awful**, **simply terrible**".

    *   **Specific Use of 'Quite':**
        *   'Quite' has **two meanings**.
        *   One meaning is to talk about a particular degree, **but not very**. For example, "I was **quite satisfied** with the result" can mean "fairly satisfied".
        *   The second meaning is to **emphasize a large degree or "very much"**. When 'quite' is used with non-gradable adjectives, it means **completely**. For example, "**You are quite wrong**" means "you are completely wrong". "**Are you quite sure?**" means "are you totally sure, are you completely sure?".

    *   **Placement in Phrases:**
        *   When adjectives are modified by degree adverbs in a phrase before a noun, the typical order is **article + degree adverb + adjective + noun**. Examples: "a **fairly** cold day", "a **very** cold day".
        *   However, certain words like 'quite' and 'rather' have a **unique ordering**, where the article often comes after them.

Understanding these concepts helps in accurately using degree adverbs to provide precise information about the intensity or extent of the qualities or actions being described.
