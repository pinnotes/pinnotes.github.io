Drawing on the sources, here is an explanation of sentences, clauses, and complex sentences.

A **sentence** is described as a structural unit in language. It is the fundamental tool for communication, and multiple sentences combine to form a discourse. A sentence has two essential components: a **subject** and a **predicate**. The predicate contains all information other than the subject, and everything within the predicate relates to the **verb**. In English, the subject and predicate are connected by agreement, specifically concerning number and person. All English sentences are considered to have a subject and a predicate, even if the subject is not explicitly stated, such as in imperative sentences. The human mind processes sentences, whether large or small, without difficulty, structurally treating even complex sentences like simple ones.

A **clause** is fundamentally related to a sentence. Conceptually, a sentence is also a clause, and a clause can function as a sentence. The key distinction between a sentence and a clause lies in **independence**.

*   An **independent clause** (also known as a main clause or matrix clause) is a sentence that has independent status. It contains a subject and a predicate and does not structurally depend on any other clause. Simple sentences are examples of independent clauses.
*   A **subordinate clause** (also known as an embedded clause or dependent clause) is a sentence-like structure that is embedded within a larger sentence. It is dependent on the main clause and does not have independent status on its own.

Sentences can be broadly classified into simple, compound, and complex sentences based on the types and arrangement of clauses they contain.

*   A **simple sentence** contains a single independent clause.
*   A **compound sentence** consists of two or more independent sentences joined together by a comma or by connectors/conjunctions such as 'and', 'or', 'but', or 'so'.
*   A **complex sentence** contains one independent clause and one or more subordinate clauses embedded within it. The presence of a subordinate clause makes a sentence complex. The subordinate clause's dependence on a constituent in the main clause is what makes the larger sentence complex. Complex sentences can contain multiple subordinate clauses. It is also possible to have embedding within embedding in a complex sentence. Despite their complexity, complex sentences are structurally similar to simple sentences in that they still primarily contain a subject, verb, and object, where the embedded clause often functions as the object of the verb in the main clause. People frequently use complex sentences in both spoken and written communication.

Subordinate clauses can have various structural **functions** within a complex sentence. The analysis of a clause involves identifying it, understanding its nature, and determining its function.

*   **Nominal clauses** (or noun clauses) function like nouns. They can occur in positions where a noun would typically appear, such as the subject of the sentence, the object of a verb, or even in apposition (giving additional information to another noun).
*   **Adjectival clauses** (or relative clauses) function like adjectives. They modify a noun, providing descriptive information about it. An adjectival clause can sometimes be replaced by a single adjective or a prepositional phrase.
*   **Adverbial clauses** function like adverbs. They provide additional information, often about the verb, the entire predicate, or some other element, acting as an adjunct. Adjuncts are generally considered optional elements in a sentence, unlike required complements (like objects).

Understanding the underlying structure of sentences and clauses, including the distinction between independent and subordinate clauses and their functions, is important for building, comprehending, and producing larger sentences, which can enhance confidence in speaking and writing.
