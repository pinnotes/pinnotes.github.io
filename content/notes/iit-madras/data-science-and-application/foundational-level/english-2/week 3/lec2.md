Based on the sources and our conversation, here is an explanation of sentences, clauses, and complex sentences:

**What is a Sentence?**

A sentence is a **structural unit in language**. It is considered the **fundamental tool for communication**. Sentences combine to form a **discourse**. A sentence is described as having **two essential parts**: a **subject** and a **predicate**. Everything within the predicate relates to the **verb**. The subject and predicate are connected by **agreement**, which in English primarily involves number and person. All English sentences are considered to have a subject and a predicate, even if the subject is not explicitly present, such as in imperative sentences. The human mind processes sentences structurally, treating even **complex sentences** like simple ones, which primarily contain a subject, verb, and object. Understanding the fundamentals of sentences is essential for producing grammatical sentences.

**What is a Clause?**

A **clause** is fundamentally related to a sentence. Conceptually, **a sentence is also a clause, and a clause can function as a sentence**. The key distinction lies in **independence**.

*   An **independent clause** (also known as a main clause or matrix clause) is a clause that has **independent status**. It is a sentence that contains a subject and a predicate and does not structurally depend on any other clause. Simple sentences are examples of independent clauses.
*   A **subordinate clause** (also known as an embedded clause or dependent clause) is a sentence-like structure that is **embedded within a larger sentence**. It is **dependent on the main clause** and does not have independent status on its own.

When a sentence is embedded within a larger sentence, that embedded sentence is called a clause. The analysis of a clause involves identifying it, understanding its nature (nominal, adjectival, or adverbial), and determining its function within the sentence.

**Complex Sentences**

Sentences can be classified based on their clause structure.

*   A **simple sentence** contains a **single independent clause**.
*   A **compound sentence** consists of **two or more independent clauses joined together** by a comma or by connectors/conjunctions such as 'and', 'or', or 'so'.
*   A **complex sentence** contains **one independent clause and one or more subordinate clauses embedded within it**. The presence of a subordinate clause makes a sentence complex. The subordinate clause's dependence on a constituent in the main clause is what makes the larger sentence complex.

Complex sentences are used frequently in both spoken and written communication. Despite their complexity, complex sentences are **structurally similar to simple sentences**. They still primarily contain a subject, verb, and object, where the embedded clause often functions as the object of the verb in the main clause. Complex sentences can contain **multiple subordinate clauses**. Embedding within embedding is also possible in complex sentences.

**Functions of Subordinate Clauses**

Subordinate clauses can have different structural **functions** within a complex sentence.

*   **Nominal clauses** (or noun clauses) **function like nouns**. They can occur in positions where a noun would typically appear, such as the **subject of the sentence**, the **object of a verb**, or even in **apposition** (giving additional information to another noun).
*   **Adjectival clauses** (or relative clauses) **function like adjectives**. They **modify a noun**, providing descriptive information about it. An adjectival clause can sometimes be replaced by a single adjective or a prepositional phrase. Structurally, adjectival clauses typically occur to the **right of the noun** they modify, contrasting with adjectives which usually precede the noun. These clauses often begin with a relative pronoun like 'which', 'who', or 'that'.
*   **Adverbial clauses** **function like adverbs**. They provide additional information, often about the verb, the entire predicate, or some other element, acting as an **adjunct**. Adverbial clauses give additional information. Adjuncts are generally considered **optional elements** in a sentence. Adverb clauses and phrases modify verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs at a sentential level.

Understanding the underlying structure of sentences and clauses, including the distinction between independent and subordinate clauses and their functions, is important for building, comprehending, and producing larger sentences, which can enhance confidence in speaking and writing.
