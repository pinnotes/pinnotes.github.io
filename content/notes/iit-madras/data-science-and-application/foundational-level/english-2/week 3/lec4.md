Drawing on the sources, let's explore Adjectival (Relative) Clauses, how they function within sentences, and see some illustrations.

First, it's helpful to understand the relationship between sentences and clauses. A **sentence** is described as a structural unit that serves as the fundamental tool for communication. A sentence contains two essential components: a subject and a predicate. Agreement between the subject and predicate, regarding number and person, is important.

Conceptually, a sentence is also a **clause**, and a clause can function as a sentence. The key distinction lies in **independence**. When a sentence is embedded within a larger sentence, that embedded sentence is called a clause.

*   An **independent clause** (also called a main clause or matrix clause) is a clause that has independent status; it does not structurally depend on any other clause. Simple sentences are examples of independent clauses. An independent clause cannot be dependent on another one.
*   A **subordinate clause** (also known as an embedded clause or dependent clause) is a sentence-like structure that is embedded within a larger sentence. It is dependent on the main clause and does not have independent status on its own. When a sentence is embedded within something, it becomes subordinate.

Sentences containing one independent clause and one or more subordinate clauses are called **complex sentences**. The presence of a subordinate clause makes a sentence complex.

Subordinate clauses can have different **structural functions** within a complex sentence. The sources discuss three main types based on their function:

1.  **Nominal clauses** (or noun clauses) function like nouns and can appear in positions such as the subject or object of a verb, or in apposition to another noun.
2.  **Adverbial clauses** function like adverbs, typically acting as adjuncts to provide additional information, often about the verb, the predicate, or another element. They are generally optional elements.
3.  **Adjectival clauses** (also known as **relative clauses**) function like adjectives.

**What is an Adjectival Clause?**

An **Adjectival Clause** is a type of subordinate clause that functions like an adjective. Its main purpose is to **modify a noun**, providing descriptive information about it. An adjectival clause can sometimes be replaced by a single adjective or a prepositional phrase that serves a similar modifying purpose.

Key characteristics highlighted in the sources include:

*   **Function:** Modifies a noun. The noun can be in various positions within the sentence, such as the subject or in an adjunct position.
*   **Placement:** Structurally, adjectival clauses typically occur to the **right of the noun** they modify. This contrasts with single adjectives in English, which usually precede the noun.
*   **Structure:** They often begin with a relative pronoun such as 'who', 'which', or 'that'. These words have a dual function; while they can be question words, when they introduce a subordinate clause modifying a noun, they function as relative pronouns. A relative pronoun refers to the noun it modifies.
*   **Optionality:** While they provide additional information about a noun, unlike complements (like objects) which are often required by the verb, adjectival clauses are adjuncts in the broader sense of adding optional information. However, within the structure of modifying the noun, they are linked to that noun.
*   **Identification:** Analyzing an adjectival clause involves identifying it, understanding its nature (adjectival), and determining its function within the sentence (which noun it modifies).

**Illustrations from the Sources:**

The sources provide several examples from the text "Swami and friends" and other sentences to illustrate adjectival clauses:

1.  **"by eight, he was at his desk in his room, which was only a corner in his father's dressing room."**. The main clause is "he was at his desk in his room". The clause **"which was only a corner in his father's dressing room"** is a subordinate adjectival clause. It modifies the noun "room", describing it further. The use of 'which' as a relative pronoun referring back to 'room' is noted. This illustrates the placement of the adjectival clause to the right of the noun it modifies.
2.  **"While the teacher was scrutinising the sums, Swaminathan was gazing on his face, which seemed so tame at close quarters."**. The main clause is "Swaminathan was gazing on his face". The clause **"which seemed so tame at close quarters"** is identified as a subordinate adjectival clause. It modifies the noun "face", describing how the face appeared. (Note: This sentence also contains an adverbial clause, "While the teacher was scrutinising the sums", illustrating that complex sentences can have multiple subordinate clauses with different functions).
3.  **"It was taken by D. Pillai who had earned a name in the school for kindness and good humour."**. The main clause is "It was taken by D. Pillai". The clause **"who had earned a name in the school for kindness and good humour"** is the subordinate adjectival clause. It modifies the noun "D. Pillai", providing additional information about him. 'Who' is the relative pronoun here.
4.  **"There were moments in it that brought stirring pictures before one."**. The main clause is "There were moments in it". The clause **"that brought stirring pictures before one"** is the subordinate adjectival clause. It qualifies the noun "moments". 'That' is used as a relative pronoun.
5.  **"Mani bullied all strangers that came his way..."**. The main clause is "Mani bullied all strangers". The clause **"that came his way"** is an adjectival clause qualifying the noun "strangers". 'That' functions as a relative pronoun here.
6.  **"Raju who lives in Chennai is a teacher of English."**. The actual main clause is "Raju is a teacher of English". The clause **"who lives in Chennai"** is a relative clause working like an adjective. It describes or gives information about the noun "Raju".
7.  **"Raju is a teacher in Chennai, which is the capital of Tamil Nadu."**. The clause **"which is the capital of Tamil Nadu"** is an adjectival clause. It describes the noun "Chennai". This shows an adjectival clause modifying a noun in the adjunct position ("in Chennai").
8.  **"He excited the curiosity that all newcomers do."**. The independent clause is "He excited the curiosity". The clause **"that all newcomers do"** is the subordinate clause working like an adjective. It qualifies the noun "curiosity" in the independent clause.

These examples illustrate how adjectival clauses provide important descriptive information by modifying nouns, contributing to the complexity and richness of sentences. Understanding their function and structure is valuable for both comprehending and producing complex language.
