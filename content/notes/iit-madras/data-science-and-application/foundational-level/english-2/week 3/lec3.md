Drawing on the sources and our conversation, here is an explanation of sentences, clauses, and complex sentences, along with illustrations from the provided text.

**What is a Sentence?**

A **sentence** is described as a structural unit in language. It serves as the **fundamental tool for communication**. Multiple sentences combine to form a discourse. A sentence has **two essential components**: a **subject** and a **predicate**. The predicate contains all information other than the subject, and everything within the predicate relates to the **verb**. In English, the subject and predicate are connected by **agreement**, specifically concerning number and person. All English sentences are considered to have a subject and a predicate, even if the subject is not explicitly stated, such as in imperative sentences. Understanding the fundamental components of a sentence is essential for producing grammatical sentences. The human mind processes sentences structurally, treating even complex sentences like simple ones.

**What is a Clause?**

A **clause** is fundamentally related to a sentence. Conceptually, **a sentence is also a clause, and a clause can function as a sentence**. The key distinction between a sentence and a clause lies in **independence**. When a sentence is embedded within a larger sentence, that embedded sentence is called a clause.

*   An **independent clause** (also known as a main clause or matrix clause) is a clause that has **independent status**. It contains a subject and a predicate and does not structurally depend on any other clause. Simple sentences are examples of independent clauses. An independent clause cannot be dependent on another one.
*   A **subordinate clause** (also known as an embedded clause or dependent clause) is a sentence-like structure that is **embedded within a larger sentence**. It is **dependent on the main clause** and does not have independent status on its own. When a sentence is embedded within something, it becomes subordinate.

The analysis of a clause involves identifying it, understanding its nature (nominal, adjectival, or adverbial), and determining its function within the sentence.

**Complex Sentences**

Sentences can be classified based on their clause structure.

*   A **simple sentence** contains a **single independent clause**.
*   A **compound sentence** consists of **two or more independent clauses joined together** by a comma or by connectors/conjunctions such as 'and', 'or', or 'so'. Examples include "I came, I saw, I conquered" joined by commas, or independent clauses joined by 'and', 'or', or 'so'.
*   A **complex sentence** contains **one independent clause and one or more subordinate clauses embedded within it**. The presence of a subordinate clause makes a sentence complex. The subordinate clause's dependence on a constituent in the main clause is what makes the larger sentence complex.

Complex sentences are used frequently in both spoken and written communication. Despite their complexity, complex sentences are structurally similar to simple sentences. They still primarily contain a subject, verb, and object, where the embedded clause often functions as the object of the verb in the main clause. Complex sentences can contain multiple subordinate clauses. Embedding within embedding is also possible in complex sentences.

**Illustrations of Sentences and Clauses:**

Let's look at some examples provided in the sources to illustrate these concepts:

*   **Simple Sentences:** Examples like "Water freezes at 0 degrees centigrade", "Water boils at 100 degrees centigrade", and "Sunrises in the east" are given as illustrations of simple sentences.
*   **Complex Sentences:**
    *   In the sentence, "I know that Sarita loves flowers", the main clause is "I know" and the embedded, subordinate clause is "that Sarita loves flowers". The embedded clause functions as the object of the verb 'know'.
    *   An example illustrating embedding within embedding is "Raju thinks that Sarita knows that Mohan likes Seema". Here, "Raju thinks" is the main clause, with "that Sarita knows that Mohan likes Seema" as its object. Within that object clause, "Sarita knows" is a clause with "that Mohan likes Seema" as *its* object. This demonstrates the layering possible in complex sentences.

**Functions of Subordinate Clauses**

Subordinate clauses can have different structural **functions** within a complex sentence. The sources highlight three main types:

*   **Nominal clauses** (or noun clauses) **function like nouns**. They can occur in positions where a noun would typically appear, such as the **subject of the sentence**, the **object of a verb**, or even in **apposition** (giving additional information to another noun).
    *   *Illustration:* In the sentence "Raju knows that Sarita loves flowers", the subordinate clause "that Sarita loves flowers" functions as the object of the verb 'know'. This is a nominal clause function.
*   **Adjectival clauses** (or relative clauses) **function like adjectives**. They **modify a noun**, providing descriptive information about it. An adjectival clause can sometimes be replaced by a single adjective or a prepositional phrase. Structurally, adjectival clauses typically occur to the **right of the noun** they modify, contrasting with adjectives which usually precede the noun. These clauses often begin with a relative pronoun like 'who', 'which', or 'that'.
    *   *Illustrations:*
        *   In the sentence "by eight, he was at his desk in his room, which was only a corner in his father's dressing room", the clause "which was only a corner in his father's dressing room" is an adjectival clause modifying the noun "room".
        *   From "Swami and friends": "Swaminathan was gazing on his face, which seemed so tame at close quarters." The clause "which seemed so tame at close quarters" is an adjectival clause modifying "face".
        *   "It was taken by D. Pillai who had earned a name in the school for kindness and good humour." The clause "who had earned a name in the school for kindness and good humour" is an adjectival clause qualifying the noun "D. Pillai".
        *   "There were moments in it that brought stirring pictures before one." The clause "that brought stirring pictures before one" is an adjectival clause qualifying the noun "moments".
        *   "Mani bullied all strangers that came his way..." The clause "that came his way" is an adjectival clause qualifying the noun "strangers".
        *   "Raju who lives in Chennai is a teacher of English." The clause "who lives in Chennai" is an adjectival clause modifying the noun "Raju".
        *   "Raju is a teacher in Chennai, which is the capital of Tamil Nadu." The clause "which is the capital of Tamil Nadu" is an adjectival clause describing the noun "Chennai".
*   **Adverbial clauses** **function like adverbs**. They provide additional information, often about the verb, the entire predicate, or some other element, acting as an **adjunct**. Adverbial clauses give additional information. Adjuncts are generally considered **optional elements** in a sentence. Adverb clauses and phrases modify verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs at a sentential level.
    *   *Illustrations:*
        *   In the sentence "While the teacher was scrutinising the sums, Swaminathan was gazing on his face which seemed so tame at close quarters", the clause "While the teacher was scrutinising the sums" is an adverbial clause, simply giving additional information.

The sources illustrate that a single complex sentence can contain **multiple subordinate clauses with different functions**. For instance, the sentence about Swaminathan gazing on his face contains *both* an adverbial clause ("While the teacher was scrutinising the sums") and an adjectival clause ("which seemed so tame at close quarters").

Understanding the underlying structure of sentences and clauses, including the distinction between independent and subordinate clauses and their functions, is important for building, comprehending, and producing larger sentences, which can enhance confidence in speaking and writing. Paying attention to how the human mind processes these structures aids language learning and production. Analyzing clauses by identifying them, understanding their nature, and determining their function is a crucial step.
