Drawing on the information from the sources, the query about "figures of speech part 2" leads us to explore further literary devices that enhance language impact. As discussed previously, figures of speech are literary devices that help make language more impactful. They make comparisons or draw parallels between unrelated things and do not provide a literal interpretation.

The source "Figures of Speech - Part 2" delves into several specific types:

*   **Irony** is a literary device that involves a funny or sad situation where the actual event turns out to be the exact opposite of what one expects. It's not limited to funny or sad, but any event opposite to expectation. We often see ironical situations and uses of language in daily life.
*   **Pun** is a device where a word is used in a way that has two meanings. This allows for saying something without saying it directly, or saying something else by saying something else. Words used in a pun can be similar in spelling or sound. The source gives the example "Can February March? No, but April May".
*   **Juxtaposition** is a device where two opposing ideas are placed next to one another. This is done to highlight the differences or similarities between the two ideas. The sources state that devices like antithesis or oxymorons are similar in nature to juxtaposition. We previously discussed juxtaposition in relation to the phrase "Do not go gentle into that good night," noting how the opposing ideas of "going gentle" and "that good night" (representing death) are placed together to create a strong contrast. The source provides "All is fair in Love and War" and "a living dead person" as examples.
*   **Synecdoche** is a device where a word or phrase uses a part to refer to the whole, or the whole to refer to a part. For example, using "the wheels" to refer to a car ("he fell asleep on the wheels"), or "a head count" to mean counting people. Using "police" to mean only part of the police force is an example of whole to part.
*   **Anaphora** is a literary device involving the technique of repetition. It is the repetition of a word or sequence of words at the beginning of a clause, phrase, or related clause. It differs from alliteration (which is repetition of a sound) by using the whole word. Examples include "Stay home. Stay safe." (repetition of "Stay") and the repetition of "and" at the beginning of lines in poetry.
*   **Metonymy** refers to the use of the name of one thing for another. This can be like using nicknames. Examples given are using "Kiwi" to refer to the New Zealand team, "the White House" to mean the US president, or "Delhi" to mean the government of India.
*   **Litotes** is a literary device that uses a negative statement to say something positive. Examples include "filthy rich" (meaning very rich), "not bad" (meaning good), or "not without truth" (meaning true).
*   **Hyperbole** is a figure of speech that emphasizes something by adding exaggerated elements to it. This refers to exaggeration. Examples include "I have been waiting forever for him to say yes" or "you speak so sweet I'll get a cavity from all the talking".
*   **Euphemism** is a well-known device for expressing taboo or embarrassing things in a particular way. It means saying something else while meaning something else. For instance, using "passed away" instead of "die," "guest worker" instead of "temporary worker," "downsizing" instead of "firing people," or "Correctional Facility" in place of "jail" or "prison". Euphemism itself is sometimes used in metaphorical contexts.

These figures of speech, along with those previously discussed such as Simile, Metaphor, and Personification (covered in "Figures of Speech - Part 1"), serve to make language richer, add emphasis and flair, and demonstrate a command over the language. Paying attention to how others use these devices in speech and writing is highlighted as a way to learn and use them effectively.
