Based on the sources and our previous conversation about language features like discourse markers and figures of speech, we can discuss the concepts of rhythm and pitch in English.

Rhythm and pitch are described as two specific and salient features of language. They are also known as extra-linguistic or prosodic features. While often used metaphorically, they are fundamentally features of speech. Understanding rhythm and pitch, along with other features like tone, stress, and accent, is crucial for improving language learning and achieving communicative confidence. They are considered embedded and in-built for native speakers but require conscious attention for learners.

Here's a breakdown based on the sources:

*   **Pitch:** Pitch refers to the intensity of sounds when we speak. It is the relative height of tones in our acoustics, meaning the high or low nature of sounds we hear. Pitch is determined by the frequency of vibration in our vocal cords. Pitches are compared as high and low. The rise and fall of pitch is significant. Pitch is an important component of accentuation or prominence at the word or sentence level.
*   **Rhythm:** Rhythm refers to the pattern in which we see certain embedded structures in the flow of speech. It is about the arrangement of sounds and syllables as a unit of speech. In English, rhythm is often stress-timed, meaning stressed syllables are produced at roughly regular intervals, separated by unstressed syllables. Rhythm can be noted through pause groups, where a certain number of syllables are spoken together and take a similar length of time.

These features play a vital role in spoken English:

*   **Making Language Impactful:** Along with tone and intonation, rhythm and pitch help make speech sound emphatic, effective, and impressive. They contribute to avoiding monotonous speech.
*   **Conveying Meaning:** They add effects that can change the meaning of a sentence or convey the speaker's intention. For example, altering the stress on different words in the same sentence changes its meaning. The pitch of the voice can also convey various emotions like shock, dullness, guilt (often low pitch) or excitement, joy, triumph (often high pitch). A balanced pitch results in a clear tone.
*   **Resolving Ambiguity:** Paying attention to intonation (which involves pitch changes) at different places in a sentence can help rule out potential ambiguities.
*   **Highlighting Information:** Intonation can be used to focus parts of the message.
*   **Aiding Comprehension and Memory:** Pitch, tone, and intonation attract attention to what is not obvious or the subtext of a conversation. Paying attention to tones and intonation can even help with memorisation.
*   **Connection to Intonation:** Intonation is closely related to pitch and tone. It is created by changing the pitch of the voice and involves variation in pitch. Intonation helps determine the type of a sentence, particularly at the end (e.g., rising intonation often marks a question).

The sources highlight that while rhythm and pitch are technical concepts related to syllable prominence, tone intensity, and pitch variation, in normal speech, we automatically organise these things to create certain impacts. Paying attention to how others use these features in spontaneous speech, reading published material, and listening to conversations are suggested ways to learn and use them effectively. Effortless-sounding speech takes effort.

Similar to how discourse markers connect ideas and add flair to conversation, rhythm and pitch add crucial layers of meaning, emotion, and impact to spoken language. Mastery of these features contributes significantly to sounding prepared and having effective control over the language.
