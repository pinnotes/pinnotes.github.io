Based on the information from the sources, discourse markers are specific elements in language, 
often found in speech, that **do not usually form part of a "serious discussion on language"** but have very important, though often undiscussed, functions. They are essentially **connectors that join ideas expressed through sentences and phrases**. Sometimes they are referred to as **"fillers," but they are important for conveying ideas and making speech or writing coherent**. Discourse markers are used in both spoken and written language.

Understanding discourse markers helps to **make language more impactful, impressive, and demonstrates a command over the language**. They are described as adding **emphasis and flair** to conversations. Effortless-sounding speech often takes a lot of effort to achieve, and paying attention to these markers is part of that effort. Language learning should be a conscious process, and focusing on discourse markers can significantly help in building sentences, ideas, and overall discourse understanding.

Here are some key aspects and functions of discourse markers:

*   **Function as Connectors:** They link independent clauses and phrases. They represent the transition of ideas and indicate a relationship between them. They connect sentences or ideas expressed in different sentences.
*   **Occur at the Beginning:** They are mostly found at the beginning of a sentence, phrase, or conversation.
*   **Can be Used Alone:** They can be used on their own without a sentence or phrase, and the listener understands what is going to follow.
*   **Aid Conversation Flow:** They help to begin a conversation, making it sound less abrupt. They can also be used to shift the focus or change the topic of a conversation.
*   **Allow for Pauses:** In spoken language, they can be used to allow for a thinking pause or merely as a placeholder (a filler). Sometimes, a pause itself can function as a discourse marker.
*   **Express Attitude or Mood:** They can help speakers express their mood or attitude. For example, positive markers like "wow," "absolutely," "yeah," "yep" indicate a positive opinion, while others can signal negativity, indifference, or unsureness (e.g., "honestly," "I guess," "I suppose").
*   **Add Emphasis:** Markers like "actually," "here is the thing," "as a matter of fact," "in fact," "apparently," "I would go as far as to say," and "hands down" are used to add emphasis.
*   **Provide Examples:** Phrases such as "for instance," "for example," and "you can see this" are used to introduce examples.
*   **Clarify:** Markers like "you see this," "you understand this," and "did you get that" (often in the form of questions) are used for clarifying points. These are commonly used in classroom settings.
*   **Create Contrast:** Markers such as "that said" and "at the same time" are used to create a contrasting effect.
*   **Conclude or Summarise:** Phrases like "overall," "all in all," "in a nutshell," "in short," and "at the end of the day" are used to conclude or summarise a conversation or a point.
*   **May Resemble Other Word Classes:** As far as word class is concerned, discourse markers may look like a conjunction, an adverbial, or an interjection.

The source provides several examples to illustrate the use and impact of discourse markers, such as in the conversation between two people discussing a property purchase, where words and phrases like "so," "oh," "you know," "I mean," "like," "well," "honestly," "anyway," "actually," "awesome," and "okay" are highlighted as discourse markers. Reading the conversation with and without these markers demonstrates how they make speech sound more natural and less abrupt.

To learn and use discourse markers effectively, it is suggested to pay attention to how others use them in spontaneous speech, read published material, and listen to conversations. This conscious observation and practice can help in incorporating them into one's own language, making it more impactful.


Based on the sources and our conversation history, discourse markers are defined and function in several ways:

**Definition of Discourse Markers:**

*   Discourse markers are **additional elements in language**.
*   They **usually do not form part of a serious discussion on language**, such as in the process of learning offline.
*   They are essentially **connectors**.
*   They **join ideas that are expressed through sentences and phrases**.
*   Sometimes, people call them "fillers," but they are **important for conveying the ideas in a coherent manner**.
*   Discourse markers are used in **spoken language or in written language**.
*   As far as the class of words is concerned, they **may look like a conjunction or an adverbial or an interjection**.

**Functions of Discourse Markers:**

Discourse markers serve important functions, even though they are not always formally discussed in language learning:

*   **Connecting Ideas:** They represent the transition of ideas and indicate a relationship between clauses and phrases. They connect two ideas expressed in two different independent sentences. Conjunctive adverbs, for example, connect independent clauses and phrases.
*   **Structuring Conversation:**
    *   They are **mostly found at the beginning** of a sentence or a phrase or a conversation.
    *   They can help **begin a conversation**, preventing it from sounding abrupt.
    *   They can also be used to **shift the focus or change the topic** of a conversation.
    *   They can be used **on their own without a sentence or a phrase**, and the listener understands what is going to follow.
*   **Managing Spoken Language Flow:** In spoken language, they can be used to **avoid repetition**, to **allow for a thinking pause**, and merely as a placeholder or "stalker". Sometimes, merely a pause is also a discourse marker.
*   **Expressing Attitude or Mood:** They help speakers in **expressing their mood or attitude**. Examples include positive markers like "wow," "absolutely," "yeah," "yep", or others that signal negative opinion, indifference, or unsureness, such as "honestly," "I guess," or "I suppose".
*   **Adding Impact and Clarity:**
    *   They **add impact**, they **add emphasis**, and they **add flair** to conversations. Using them makes language sound more impactful, effective, and impressive.
    *   Effortless-sounding speech often takes a lot of effort, and paying attention to discourse markers is part of this effort.
    *   They can be used to **add emphasis**. Examples include "actually," "here is the thing," "as a matter of fact," "in fact," "apparently," "I would go as far as to say," and "hands down".
    *   They are used to **give more examples**, such as "for instance," "for example," and "you can see this".
    *   Certain markers like "you see this," "you understand this," and "did you get that" (often in question form) are used for **clarifying**.
    *   Markers like "that said" and "at the same time" are used to **create contrast**.
    *   Phrases such as "overall," "all in all," "in a nutshell," "in short," and "at the end of the day" are used to **conclude or summarise**.
*   **Aiding Language Learning:** Paying attention to discourse markers as part of language learning can help in building sentences, ideas, and understanding discourse. Learning how others use them in spontaneous speech, reading published material, and listening to conversations are suggested ways to incorporate them into one's own language. This conscious process can lead to sounding more prepared and having effective control over language. They are related to developing communicative confidence.

In essence, while they might seem like minor additions or "fillers," discourse markers are fundamental tools for organising thought, maintaining conversational flow, expressing attitude, adding emphasis, and making spoken and written language coherent and impactful.
