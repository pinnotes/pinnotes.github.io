Drawing on the information from the sources you provided, the two YouTube videos titled "Figures of Speech - Part 1" and "Figures of Speech - Part 2" discuss **figures of speech** as literary devices that help make language more **impactful**. They contribute to making a speaker sound more prepared and demonstrate a good and effective control over language. Figures of speech can be used to say more or less than what is literally meant. Their use can take language performance to the next level, demonstrating command and control, adding to confidence, and enabling the ability to function better in that language. Figures of speech help language become better and get combined with the efficient use of grammatically accurate and situationally appropriate language. They make our language **richer**.

Figures of speech are described as a specific device that can be used in both **written and spoken language**. They are also considered **literary devices**. A complete list of figures of speech is not readily available; they are often part of a native speaker's capacity, particularly metaphors which can be contextual and culturally grounded. While native speakers may acquire them effortlessly from context, paying attention to them, their context of use, and their function can help non-native speakers use them effortlessly and effectively over time. This involves continuous and careful practice, reading published material, listening to spontaneous speech, and allowing these devices to evolve in one's subconscious.

Here are some of the figures of speech discussed in the sources:

*   **Simile**: This is a type of comparison of two completely unassociated things or ideas. It does not provide a literal interpretation. Simile most commonly uses the words "like" or "as" to draw the comparison.
    *   Examples given include: "Oh my love is like a red red rose", "I wandered lonely as a cloud", "He is as modest as a hermit", "a face as dull as lead", "cheeks like blessing cloud", "eyes as bright as blazing star", "bold as Hawk", "as steady as clock".
    *   The purpose is to create impact, provide comparison, make language impactful, create a picture, personify qualities, and offer an indirect way of complimenting.

*   **Metaphor**: This is also a type of comparison where a word or phrase is used in place of another to suggest likeness or analogy between the two things. Like simile, a metaphor does not carry any literal meaning. The word "metaphor" itself is presented as a metaphor.
    *   Examples include: "the icing on the cake" (referring to the better part of something), "silence as golden" (referring to the worth of being silent), "life is a roller coaster" (referring to alternating highs and lows, good and bad times), "all the world's a stage and all the men and women merely players".
    *   Using metaphors takes language to another level of completeness, demonstrates command over language, and makes it impactful.

*   **Personification**: In personification, a thing or an idea is given human attributes or emotions. It helps establish a deeper connection with readers and creates poetic expressions in speech and writing.
    *   Examples given are: "books are my favorite companions" (comparing inanimate books to human companions), "the stars winked at us from the distant black sky" (attributing the human action of winking to stars), and attributing feminine qualities and actions ("gave or withheld great fevers", "did wild or wicked things") to "her" (presumably the sea) in an excerpt from Ernest Hemingway's *The Old Man and the Sea*.
    *   Personification adds to achieving assertiveness and convincing qualities in communication.

*   **Paradox**: A paradox is a situation or statement that is true but sounds impossible or conflicting. It consists of two contrasting facts or characteristics and is used as a thought-provoking element, especially in literature.
    *   Examples include: "men work together whether they work together or apart", "all animals are equal but some are more equal than others", "I must be cruel to be kind".
    *   Paradoxes make language intelligent and add wit and impact.

*   **Oxymoron**: An oxymoron is an expression that contains two words which have opposite meanings placed together. It combines contradictory words.
    *   Examples provided are: "Bittersweet experience", "awfully good movie", "sweet sorrow", "oh brawling love oh loving hate".
    *   Oxymoron is used to express conflicting opinions or thoughts.

*   **Antithesis**: This device involves two components in opposition that follow a **parallel grammatical structure**. This parallel structure contributes to rhythmic writing and speech.
    *   Examples include: "No pain no gain" (Pain and Gain are opposite rhyming words), "Man proposes God disposes", "To err is human to forgive is divine".

*   **Alliteration**: Alliteration involves words that begin with the **same sound**. It is often poetic in nature. While sometimes used in spoken language, it is mostly seen in writing. It is different from anaphora which involves repetition of whole words. There are at least three types of alliteration based on sound repetition: assonance (vowel sounds), consonance (consonant sounds), and sibilance ('s' or 'sh' sounds). When consonant sounds are repeated at the end of words, it can form a rhythmic structure.
    *   Examples given: "Betty baked buns besides Bakers" (repetition of 'b' sound), "Coca-Cola", "PayPal", "Peppa Pig", "KitKat", "Jack and Jill went up the hill", "Too cool for the school", "Chips and dips", "Surf and turf", "She sells seashells by the seashore".
    *   Poets use alliteration for careful word selection to create a desired impact. Alliterative devices aim to create something simpler and impactful in presentation.

*   **Irony**: Irony is described as being metaphorical itself. It involves a funny or sad situation where the actual event turns out to be the exact opposite of what was expected. This can apply to any event that turns out opposite to expectation.
    *   No specific examples are given beyond the general definition, but the source notes that ironical situations and language uses are seen frequently in day-to-day life.

*   **Pun**: A pun is a device where a word is used in a way that has two meanings. Words used in puns could be similar in spelling or sound. Puns are seen as a good rhetorical/literary device for regular speech. They help say something without saying so, or say something else by saying something else. The phrase "pun is not intended" or "pun is intended" is used in situations where the intended multiple meanings might not be caught.
    *   An example is: "Can February March? No, but April May".

*   **Juxtaposition**: This device places two opposing ideas next to one another to highlight differences or similarities. Other devices like antithesis or oxymorons are similar in nature to juxtaposition.
    *   Examples include: "All is fair in love and war", "A living dead person".

*   **Synecdoche**: Synecdoche is a device where a word or phrase is used such that a **part** of it refers to the **whole**, or the **whole** refers to just a **part**.
    *   Examples given are: "He fell asleep on the wheels" ("wheels" refers to the whole car), "Can we have a head count?" ("head count" refers to counting people), and using "police" to refer only to a part of the police force.

*   **Anaphora**: As a literary device, anaphora is a technique of **repetition of a word or sequence of words** at the **beginning** of a clause, phrase, or related clause. It is seen often in advertising and poetry. It is distinct from alliteration which repeats only sounds.
    *   Examples include: "Stay home stay safe" (repetition of "stay"), and the repetition of "and" at the beginning of lines in an excerpt from T.S. Eliot's *The Waste Land*.

*   **Metonymy**: This device refers to the use of the **name of one thing for another**. This can involve using nicknames.
    *   Examples are: referring to the New Zealand team as "the Kiwis", the President of the United States as "the White House", and the government of India as "Delhi".

*   **Litotes**: Litotes is a literary device that uses a **negative statement to say something positive**.
    *   Examples include: "Filthy Rich" (meaning very rich), "not bad" (meaning good), and "not without truth" (meaning true).

*   **Hyperbole**: Hyperbole is a figure of speech that **emphasizes something by adding exaggerated elements** to it.
    *   Examples: "I have been waiting forever for him to say yes" (exaggerating the waiting time), "You speak so sweet I'll get a cavity from all the talking" (exaggerating the sweetness). Saying "cats and dogs" might also be an example of exaggeration.

*   **Euphemism**: Euphemism is a way of expressing **taboo or embarrassing things** in a particular way, saying something else but meaning something else. Euphemism itself can be used in metaphorical contexts.
    *   Examples provided: Using "passed away" instead of "died", "guest worker" instead of "daily wage worker" or "temporary worker", "downsizing" instead of "firing people", "well-fed" instead of "overweight", "outspoken" instead of "nasty or bossing", and "Correctional Facility" in place of "jail or prison".

Understanding and using these figures of speech can make language more effective and expressive. They add emphasis and flair to conversation and writing. Paying attention to how others use them is crucial for incorporating them into one's own language.
