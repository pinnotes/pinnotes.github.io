{{< border type="question" >}}
**1**. Which among the following sentences use discourse markers to express opinion
{{< /border >}}

{{< border type="tip" title="Solution" >}}
Drawing on the information in the sources, discourse markers are words or phrases that can be used to help structure conversation or express the speaker's attitude or viewpoint. They can appear at the beginning of a sentence and take the entire sentence into their scope.

Examining the sentences you provided based on the sources:

{{< border type="question" >}}
*   "**I guess** he rode the vehicle yesterday"
    *   Source states that using phrases like "I guess so" can show indifference or a subtle negative opinion. This suggests that "I guess" functions as a discourse marker that indicates a level of uncertainty or a tentative opinion. In this sentence, "**I guess**" is used to express the speaker's tentative opinion about the likelihood of him riding the vehicle yesterday.

*   "Moreover, they performed well in the auditions"
    *   The sources discuss discourse markers that are used to add more information. Phrases like "just to add," "to my knowledge," "as far as I know," "on top of that," and "another thing" are mentioned in this context. "Moreover" falls into this category of adding information to a previous statement or idea, rather than primarily expressing a personal opinion about the content that follows.

*   "Firstly, he has to show his capabilities"
    *   The sources mention discourse markers like "first of all," "to begin with," "for starters," and "at the outset" which are used to begin a conversation or to indicate the start of a list of points. "Firstly" is an adverb that serves a similar function of sequencing points in discourse. It does not inherently express an opinion about the capability itself, but rather marks this as the initial requirement.

*   "He was the first one to finish the task"
    *   This sentence does not appear to use a discourse marker to express opinion, based on the categories and examples provided in the sources. "The first one" here refers to order or rank within the context of finishing the task, not a comment on the statement itself.

Therefore, among the sentences provided, the one that uses a discourse marker to express opinion (specifically, a tentative or uncertain opinion) is:

*   **"I guess he rode the vehicle yesterday"**

3. Discourse markers are syntactically independent. This statement is ___.

- True
- False
{{< /border >}}

{{< border type="tip" title="Solution" >}}
Based on the information in the sources, the statement "Discourse markers are syntactically independent" is **True**.

The sources describe discourse markers as **"additional elements in language"** that **"usually do not form part of a serious discussion on language"**. They are referred to as **"connectors that join ideas that are expressed through sentences and phrases"** and are sometimes called **"fillers"**.

Crucially, the sources explicitly state that discourse markers **"can very well be used... on their own without a sentence or a phrase"**. This ability to function independently of a complete sentence or phrase is a strong indicator of their syntactic independence. They are also **"mostly found at the beginning of a sentence or a phrase or a conversation a starter"**, suggesting a position outside the core grammatical structure. While they **"may look like a conjunction or an adverbial or an interjection"**, their function as discourse markers is important **"irrespective of which class they belong to"**. Their function is to manage discourse, connect ideas, or express attitude or viewpoint, rather than fulfilling a core grammatical role necessary for sentence structure.

In contrast, elements like **complements** are described as **"essential, structurally indispensable part of a sentence clause or a phrase"**. Removing a complement makes the sentence **"incomplete"** and **"ungrammatical"**. **Adjuncts**, while often optional, typically modify verbs or other elements *within* the sentence structure. The description of discourse markers as "additional" and capable of standing alone positions them as more syntactically independent than even adjuncts, as they do not necessarily modify anything within the adjacent sentence but rather relate it to the broader discourse or express the speaker's stance.

4. Which of the following markers express justification to an already stated statement?

- In addition to that
- I mean
- Apparently
- None of the above
{{< /border >}}

{{< border type="tip" title="Solution" >}}
Based on the information provided in the sources and our conversation history:

Let's examine how each of the listed markers is described in the sources.

1.  **In addition to that**: The sources categorize phrases like "**on top of that**" and "**another thing**" as being used to add more information. They are described as ways "**to add to the conversation**" and carry the conversation forward by adding features or associations. While "In addition to that" functions similarly in general English, the sources explicitly list "**on top of that**" in this additive category. The function is adding information, not justifying a preceding statement.

2.  **I mean**: The sources list "**I mean like**" as a discourse marker or filler, sometimes used to reorganize ideas or sequence things. "**I mean**" is also mentioned in a context indicating indifference or a subtle negative opinion, such as when used before "I need to think about it". None of the sources describe "I mean" as a marker that expresses justification.

3.  **Apparently**: The sources identify "**apparently**" as an adverb and a sentence adverb. It indicates **likelihood** or adds a comment, suggesting that the speaker is "**not really sure**" or "**does not talk about certainty**". It can also be used "**to add emphasis**". For example, "**apparently he is the one who spilled the beans**" is given as an example of adding emphasis. These descriptions relate to the speaker's attitude towards the certainty or source of the information, rather than providing a reason or justification for why a statement is true or valid.

Based on the functions of these markers as described in the provided sources, none of them are presented as markers that express justification for an already stated statement. Additive markers add information, "I mean" can be a filler or show indifference, and "apparently" indicates likelihood, uncertainty, or emphasis.

Therefore, drawing solely on the information in the sources:

Which of the following markers express justification to an already stated statement?
- In addition to that
- I mean
- Apparently
- **None of the above**

5. “He did not clear the exam and, as a result, he could not apply for that job.” Here the discourse marker is ____.

- Did not clear
- As a result
- Could not
- No discourse marker
{{< /border >}}

{{< border type="tip" title="Solution" >}}
Based on the information in the sources and our conversation history, let's analyse the sentence "He did not clear the exam and, as a result, he could not apply for that job" to identify the discourse marker.

The sources describe discourse markers as **connectors that join ideas that are expressed through sentences and phrases**. They are sometimes called **fillers**, but they are important for conveying ideas in a **coherent manner**. Discourse markers in written language **may show cause and effect**, contrast, and addition, among other relationships. They can very well be used on their own without a sentence or a phrase and are generally considered **additional elements in language**.

In the sentence "He did not clear the exam and, as a result, he could not apply for that job":

*   "He did not clear the exam" is the first clause.
*   "he could not apply for that job" is the second clause.

The phrase **"as a result"** connects these two clauses. It indicates that the second event (not being able to apply for the job) is a consequence or outcome of the first event (not clearing the exam). This explicitly shows a **cause and effect** relationship between the two parts of the sentence, which is one of the functions attributed to discourse markers in the sources.

While the sources don't explicitly list "as a result" as an example, they do mention **"consequently"** as a conjunctive adverb that connects two clauses and shows a relationship, specifically indicating a result or consequence following a preceding statement. The phrase "as a result" functions in a very similar way, serving to link the cause (failing the exam) to the effect (inability to apply). It fits the description of a marker that joins ideas and shows a relationship.

Looking at the provided options:

*   **Did not clear**: This is part of the verb phrase in the first clause and is essential to its meaning. It is not a discourse marker.
*   **As a result**: This phrase functions to connect the two clauses and indicate the consequence of the first event. This aligns with the description of discourse markers showing cause and effect.
*   **Could not**: This is part of the verb phrase in the second clause and is essential to its meaning. It is not a discourse marker.
*   **No discourse marker**: Since "as a result" fits the description of a discourse marker showing cause and effect and connecting ideas as outlined in the sources, this option is incorrect.

Therefore, the discourse marker in the sentence, based on its function of showing cause and effect and connecting the two parts of the sentence as described in the sources, is **"as a result"**.

The correct answer is **As a result**.
