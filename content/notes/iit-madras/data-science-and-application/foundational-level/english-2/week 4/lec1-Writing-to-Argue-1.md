### **Writing to Argue - Part I: Making Your Point Effectively**

This session focuses on **how to write and speak persuasively**, especially when dealing with controversial topics where there are arguments for and against different viewpoints. The goal is to make your communication impactful and convincing.

Here are the key takeaways:

*   **1. The Importance of Content (It's Not Just About Grammar!):**
    *   While grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation are important, **your knowledge of the subject and what you have to say (your content) is paramount**. Without solid content, language itself has little impact.
    *   **How to create content?** ü§î Even if you don't feel like an expert, you likely know enough. Start by making a **synopsis** (an overview or hints) of relevant points you want to discuss. This helps organise your thoughts before you start writing or speaking.

*   **2. Presenting Arguments (The Two-Sided Coin):**
    *   When arguing, you should **consider both (or even multiple) sides of an issue**. Policies and decisions rarely have undisputed solutions.
    *   For example, allowing big companies into the retail sector has arguments for and against it. To write a good report, you need to acknowledge and address these different perspectives.
    *   This approach helps you present a well-rounded and convincing case.

*   **3. The Language of Argument (Words That Persuade):**
    *   Argumentative writing and speaking use a **specific kind of language**. This language helps convey your preference or emphasis on different options within an issue.
    *   **Common phrases and expressions** include: "on the one hand," "as far as," "as well as," "point of view," "in my view," "in view of," "on consideration," and "on considering".
    *   **Adjectives and adverbs** are crucial for indicating your preference. For instance, using "least polluting" instead of just "polluting," or "most cost-effective" instead of "cost-effective". Words like "least," "most," "more," "less," "little," "much," and "many" become part of this argumentative language.
    *   **Expressions demanding consideration** or requesting attention (e.g., "before we conclude," "while we are at it") also feature prominently.
    *   Even when discussing statistics, you might use phrases like "nearly," "a little over," "a little under," or "almost half" to connect numbers meaningfully.

*   **4. Learning by Doing (Practice Makes Perfect!):**
    *   **Languages are best learned by doing**, not just by listening or watching.
    *   **Practice regularly**: Start by taking notes from spoken or written arguments. Then, try to write your own arguments on controversial topics.
    *   **Draft and revise**: Don't expect perfection in your first attempt. Write multiple drafts, continuously cutting and pruning to make your arguments concise and impactful. Compare your work with model answers or samples to see areas for improvement. This iterative process enhances not just your language but also your overall perspective and intellectual growth.

### **Answers** ‚úÖ
