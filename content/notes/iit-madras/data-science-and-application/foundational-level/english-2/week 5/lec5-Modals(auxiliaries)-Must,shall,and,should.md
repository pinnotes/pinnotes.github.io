Hello there! Building on our previous discussions about modal verbs, let's explore three more crucial ones: **Must**, **Shall**, and **Should**.

As we've established, **modal verbs** (also known as modal auxiliaries) are special types of auxiliary verbs [Previous Conversation, 489, 500, 506, 696]. A key characteristic is that they are **non-tensed auxiliaries** [Previous Conversation, 498, 500, 506, 696]. This means they *do not* inherently indicate tense on their own, nor do they take inflections like '-ing', '-es', or '-ed' [Previous Conversation, 695, 696, 698, 699]. They are used to express various modalities such as likelihood, ability, request, capacity, suggestion, obligation, or advice [Previous Conversation, 481, 489, 677, 698]. It's also important to remember that modal auxiliaries like 'could', 'might', 'should', and 'would' are **independent modal auxiliaries** and are *not* simply the past forms of 'can', 'may', 'shall', or 'will'.

Let's break down 'Must', 'Shall', and 'Should' with ease!

---

### 1. **Must** 🌟

The **core meaning** of 'must' is **necessity**.

*   **Necessity** (based on the speaker's knowledge or deduction) 🧠
    *   It indicates a strong deduction or certainty about something.
    *   Example: "Look at how thick that canopy is. Trees **must** have many branches." (Deduction based on observation)
    *   Example: "Fan is not working. It **must** be power failure." (Deduction)

*   **Obligation** (varying in strength) 🤝
    *   **Self-imposed obligation** (weak form, often with first-person pronouns, like a reminder to oneself).
        *   Example: "I **must** visit him today."
        *   Example: "I **must** clean the room now."
    *   **Non-personal obligation** (involves human performers but is not a direct personal imposition).
        *   Example: "Submissions **must** follow the guidelines as instructed by the scientific committee."
    *   **Social obligation** (vague in terms of actual occurrence, but socially expected).
        *   Example: "We are going to Bangalore tomorrow. We **must** visit Ramesh's uncle and his family."

*   **Negative Counterpart: Must not (Mustn't)** 🚫
    *   Indicates **necessity in obligations** and is often more **forceful**. It implies something is forbidden or highly discouraged [31C].
    *   Example: "You **must not** be distracted while driving."
    *   Example: "You **must not** use your phones while at fuel station."

### 2. **Shall** 🚀

'Shall' is primarily used to indicate an element of **determination** on the part of the speaker. It can also show intention, willingness, and prediction when used as a modal auxiliary.

*   **Determination / Intention / Willingness / Prediction** 💪
    *   Often used with first-person pronouns (I/we) in contemporary English to show a strong resolve or plan.
    *   Example: "I **shall** talk to you about the proposal tomorrow." (Shows intention/determination)
    *   Example: "We **shall** have finished the work by noon."

*   **Strong Obligation** (often socially oriented, particularly in legal or formal contexts) 📜
    *   This usage implies a very firm rule or command, typically found in official language.
    *   Example: "The doctors who do not abide by the guidelines of IMA for practicing medicine **shall** have their licenses revoked with immediate effect."
    *   Example: "The petitioners **shall** present the affidavit in regard to the issues submitted to the court."

*   **Note on 'Will' Interchangeability**: While 'shall' can sometimes be used interchangeably with 'will' as a *tense auxiliary* (e.g., in expressing future tense), when 'shall' functions as a *modal auxiliary*, it is *not* considered a substitute for 'will'. It carries a stronger sense of determination or obligation.

### 3. **Should** ✅

The core meaning of 'should' is **requirement**. It is commonly used in socially rooted contexts to indicate weak obligations, advice, or suggestions.

*   **Requirement / Advice / Suggestion** 👍
    *   Indicates what is considered appropriate behaviour or a good idea. It's less forceful than 'must' [32E].
    *   Example: "You **should** prepare well for the learner's test." (Advice/Requirement)
    *   Example: "You **should** inform me before you leave." (Requirement/Weak obligation)
    *   Example: "It's a good film. You **should** go and see it." [32B]
    *   **Alternative**: 'Ought to' can be used as another way to say 'should' [32F].

*   **Strong Denial** (when used with 'why' questions) 🤷‍♀️
    *   This construction often functions as a rhetorical question, denying the relevance or possibility of an action.
    *   Example: "Why **should** I see the movie? I don't." (Strong denial of watching the movie)
    *   Example: "Why **should** we do what everyone else does?" (Denial)

*   **Probability** 🎲
    *   Can indicate what is most probable or expected to happen.
    *   Example: "This work **should** take two or three days." (Indicates probability)
    *   Example: "Your order **should** be delivered in six to seven days." (Indicates probability)

### Key Distinctions Summary 🔑

*   **Must**: Strongest for **necessity** or **strong obligation** (especially prohibitions with 'must not').
*   **Shall**: Formal, often indicates **speaker's determination** or **strong, often legal, obligation**.
*   **Should**: Weaker, for **advice**, **suggestions**, **weak obligations**, or what is generally required/expected.
