Hello there! Building on our previous discussions about modal verbs, let's dive into two more: **May** and **Might**.

As we've established, **modal verbs** (also known as modal auxiliaries) are special types of auxiliary verbs [Previous Conversation, 497, 513, 519, 681]. A key characteristic is that they are **non-tensed auxiliaries** [Previous Conversation, 498, 513, 519, 681]. This means they *do not* inherently indicate tense on their own, nor do they take inflections like '-ing', '-es', or '-ed'. They are used to express various modalities such as likelihood, ability, request, capacity, suggestion, obligation, or advice [Previous Conversation, 481, 497, 683]. It's also important to remember that modal auxiliaries like 'could', 'might', 'should', and 'would' are **independent modal auxiliaries** and are *not* simply the past forms of 'can', 'may', 'shall', or 'will'.

Let's break down 'May' and 'Might' with ease!

---

### 1. **May** 🌸

The **core meaning** of 'may' is **possibility**.

*   **Possibility** (often with a sense of **politeness** or **uncertainty**):
    *   It indicates that something is possible, but not certain.
    *   **Grammatically**, 'may' expresses the possibility of occurrence or non-occurrence (e.g., "The delivery may be delayed" means it may or may not be delayed).
    *   **Pragmatically** (in social use), 'may' is often used politely to inform about a delay or a possibility, even when the speaker might have some certainty about the event.
        *   Example: "The delivery **may** be delayed." (Literally, it's possible it will be delayed or not. Pragmatically, it's a polite way of saying it *will* probably be delayed).
        *   Example: "They **may** call us tomorrow." (Means they may or may not call).

*   **Permission** (in a **formal** setting): 🙏
    *   'May' is used to ask for or give permission, primarily in formal contexts.
    *   It adds a sense of politeness and can highlight a difference in social power or hierarchy. When you reduce your own ability to do something, it makes the context more formal and shows a sense of surrender or total dependence.
        *   Example: "**May** I take a tea break?" (Formal request for permission).
        *   Example: "You **may** carry your handbags inside the room." (Polite permission given).
    *   **Comparison with 'Can'**: While 'can' can also be used for permission, 'can' embeds an interpretation of demonstrating ability (e.g., "I can run"), making it less formal. 'May' removes this sense of capability or authority, making it more formal.

*   **Concession**: ✅
    *   'May' can also be used to acknowledge the possibility of an event and its relevance.
        *   Example: "The school **may** be open on Sunday, but children will not go." (Acknowledges the possibility of the school being open for other reasons).
        *   Example: "He **may** be a child, but he is very wise.".

### 2. **Might** 🤷‍♀️

'Might' is an **independent modal auxiliary** and is **not** the past tense form of 'may'.

*   **Possibility** (indicating **weaker** or **remote** possibility): 📉
    *   Like 'may', 'might' also indicates possibility and permission, but it specifically suggests a **weaker** or **more remote** possibility. It leans more towards uncertainty than certainty.
    *   This can include hypothetical or totally unreal interpretations.
        *   Example: "The bus **might** be late." (Implies a weaker chance of being late than if 'may' were used).
        *   Example: "She is a bright student, so she **might** become successful in life." (Indicates a remote possibility; the chance is low).
        *   Example: "He **might** have been successful in his career, had he listened to his boss." (Refers to a past possibility that did not happen).

*   **Permission** (indicating **even less likely** or **less relevant** situations): 🙏 (but even more tentative)
    *   While technically possible for permission, its use in this context would imply a very remote or less likely scenario, making it much more tentative than 'may'.

*   **Concession** (for **less likely** or **less relevant** situations):
    *   This project **might** happen, but we are not going to talk about it now." (Indicates a very low chance of the event occurring, almost impossible).

### Solutions ✅

1.  I haven't heard from John all day. He **might** be busy with his new project. 🤔 (Indicates a deduction based on limited information, a possibility that is not strong).
2.  The doctor said I **may** leave the hospital tomorrow, if my condition improves. 🏥 (Giving permission or stating a clear possibility based on a condition).
3.  If you don't study for the exam, you **could** fail. 😬 (The source specifically uses 'could' for future possibility in this context, although 'might' can also be used for possibility, 'could' is directly cited here).
4.  The CEO **might** attend the meeting, but it's a very weak possibility given his schedule. 🏢 (Emphasizes a very remote or weak possibility).
5.  **May** I come in? I have an urgent matter to discuss. 🗣️ (Formal request for permission).
6.  Living in a big city **can** cost a fortune. 💰 (The source uses 'can' for general possibilities, indicating what is generally possible in the world. While 'may' or 'might' are for possibility, 'can' is the most appropriate for *general* possibilities as per the sources).
7.  She **might** not like the surprise party; she prefers quiet evenings. 🎉 (Expresses a weaker possibility or uncertainty about her reaction).
