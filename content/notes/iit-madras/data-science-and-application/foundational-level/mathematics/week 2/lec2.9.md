The **General Equation of a Line** is the most comprehensive and universal way to represent any straight line in the coordinate plane. It's like the master key 🗝️ that fits all types of lines!

### Understanding the General Equation of a Line 📏

The general equation of a line is written in the form:
$\mathbf{Ax + By + C = 0}$

Here's what each part means:
*   **`x` and `y`**: These are the **variables** that represent the coordinates of any point (`(x, y)`) lying on the line.
*   **`A`, `B`, and `C`**: These are **real number constants**.
*   **Crucial Condition** ⚠️: For this equation to truly represent a line, the constants `A` and `B` **cannot both be zero simultaneously**. If they were, the equation would simplify to `C = 0`, which is either `0 = 0` (true for all points) or a false statement (e.g., `5 = 0`), neither of which describes a single line.

### Why is it so Universal? 🌐

One of the greatest strengths of the general form is its ability to represent *every* type of straight line, including those that other forms might struggle with, like vertical lines.

*   **Vertical Lines** ⬆️:
    *   Vertical lines have an **undefined slope** because there's no change in the x-direction (`Δx = 0`).
    *   In the `Ax + By + C = 0` form, if **`B = 0`**, the equation simplifies to `Ax + C = 0`.
    *   This can be rearranged to `x = -C/A`, which perfectly describes a vertical line where the x-coordinate is constant. For example, `x = 5` is a vertical line.

*   **Horizontal Lines** ↔️:
    *   Horizontal lines have a **slope of 0**.
    *   In the `Ax + By + C = 0` form, if **`A = 0`**, the equation becomes `By + C = 0`.
    *   This can be rearranged to `y = -C/B`, which describes a horizontal line where the y-coordinate is constant. For example, `y = 7` is a horizontal line.

*   **All Other Lines** 📈📉:
    *   All other lines that are neither perfectly vertical nor perfectly horizontal can also be easily expressed in this general form. In fact, all other specific forms of line equations (like slope-point, slope-intercept, two-point, and intercept forms) can be rearranged into this general `Ax + By + C = 0` form.

This means the general equation of a line is a powerful algebraic representation of a geometric object.

### Extracting Information from the General Form 🔍

From the general equation `Ax + By + C = 0`, you can readily determine key characteristics of the line:

*   **Slope (m)**:
    *   If `B ≠ 0`, the slope of the line is given by: $\mathbf{m = -A/B}$.
*   **Y-intercept (c)**:
    *   If `B ≠ 0`, the y-intercept (where the line crosses the Y-axis, i.e., `x = 0`) is: $\mathbf{c = -C/B}$.
*   **X-intercept (d)**:
    *   If `A ≠ 0`, the x-intercept (where the line crosses the X-axis, i.e., `y = 0`) is: $\mathbf{d = -C/A}$.

These direct relationships make the general form incredibly useful for quickly understanding a line's properties.

### Practice Question 1: General Equation of a Line ✍️

Given the general equation of a line: $\mathbf{5x + 10y - 30 = 0}$

a) Find its slope.
b) Find its x-intercept.
c) Find its y-intercept.

**Solution:**

1.  **Identify Coefficients** ✅:
    First, compare the given equation `5x + 10y - 30 = 0` with the general form `Ax + By + C = 0`.
    *   `A = 5`
    *   `B = 10`
    *   `C = -30`

2.  **a) Find the Slope (m)** 📈:
    The formula for the slope is `m = -A/B`.
    Substitute the identified values:
    `m = -5 / 10`
    $\mathbf{m = -1/2}$ ✅

3.  **b) Find the X-intercept (d)** ⬅️:
    The formula for the x-intercept is `d = -C/A`.
    Substitute the identified values:
    `d = -(-30) / 5`
    `d = 30 / 5`
    $\mathbf{d = 6}$ ✅

4.  **c) Find the Y-intercept (c)** 📍:
    The formula for the y-intercept is `c = -C/B`.
    Substitute the identified values:
    `c = -(-30) / 10`
    `c = 30 / 10`
    $\mathbf{c = 3}$ ✅
