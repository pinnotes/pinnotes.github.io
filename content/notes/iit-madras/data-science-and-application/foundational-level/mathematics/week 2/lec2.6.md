The **slope of a line** tells us about its steepness and direction üìà. Building on our previous discussion about the slope of a line, we can now understand a very important relationship between lines: **parallel lines**.

### What are Parallel Lines?

Imagine two straight roads that run side-by-side forever and never cross paths, no matter how far they extend üõ£Ô∏èüõ£Ô∏è. That's essentially what parallel lines are in geometry!

Formally, two lines are **parallel** if they lie in the same plane and do not intersect, no matter how far they are extended in either direction.

### The Role of Slope in Parallel Lines üìê

The concept of slope is crucial for identifying parallel lines.

*   **Same Steepness and Direction**: Parallel lines always have the **same steepness** and point in the **same direction**. This means they have the **same slope**. The slope, `m`, describes the ratio of the change in the vertical direction (`Œîy`) to the change in the horizontal direction (`Œîx`), also known as "rise by run".

*   **Inclination**: The slope of a line is also related to its angle of inclination, `Œ∏`, with respect to the positive x-axis (`m = tan(Œ∏)`). If two lines are parallel, they will have the **same inclination**. Therefore, if their inclinations (`Œ±` and `Œ≤`) are the same (`Œ± = Œ≤`), then their tangents will also be the same (`tan Œ± = tan Œ≤`), which means their slopes are equal (`m1 = m2`).

*   **Condition for Parallel Lines**: Two **non-vertical** lines are parallel **if and only if** their slopes are equal. The term "if and only if" means this is a two-way condition:
    *   If two non-vertical lines are parallel, then their slopes must be equal.
    *   If the slopes of two non-vertical lines are equal, then the lines are parallel.

*   **Vertical Lines Exception** ‚ö†Ô∏è: It is important to note the "non-vertical" part of the condition. Vertical lines have an **undefined slope**. However, two vertical lines are considered parallel to each other. When discussing the slope-based condition for parallel lines, it's generally applied to non-vertical lines where the slope is properly defined.

*   **Uniqueness**: While parallel lines have the same slope, a given slope does **not** uniquely determine a line; there can be **infinitely many parallel lines** with the same slope. For instance, if you have a line with a slope of 2, any other line with a slope of 2 will be parallel to it, but it could cross the y-axis at any point (different y-intercepts).

### Practice Questions and Solutions üß†

Here are some practice questions to help you apply the concept of parallel lines!

**Practice Question 1: Determining Parallelism from Points**
Q: Are the lines passing through the following pairs of points parallel?
Line 1: P(1, 2) and Q(3, 8) üìçüìç
Line 2: R(-1, 0) and S(0, 3) üìçüìç

**Solution:**
To determine if the lines are parallel, we need to calculate the slope of each line and compare them. The slope formula is $m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$.

1.  **Slope of Line 1 (m1)**:
    Points: P(1, 2) and Q(3, 8)
    $m_1 = \frac{8 - 2}{3 - 1}$
    $m_1 = \frac{6}{2}$
    **$m_1 = 3$** ‚úÖ

2.  **Slope of Line 2 (m2)**:
    Points: R(-1, 0) and S(0, 3)
    $m_2 = \frac{3 - 0}{0 - (-1)}$
    $m_2 = \frac{3}{1}$
    **$m_2 = 3$** ‚úÖ

3.  **Comparison**:
    Since $m_1 = m_2 = 3$, the slopes are equal. Therefore, the lines passing through the given pairs of points **are parallel**.

**Practice Question 2: Determining Parallelism from Equations**
Q: Are the lines represented by the following equations parallel?
Line A: $2x - 4y + 5 = 0$ üìè
Line B: $x - 2y - 3 = 0$ üìè

**Solution:**
To determine if the lines are parallel, we need to find the slope of each line from their general equation form ($Ax + By + C = 0$). The slope `m` can be found using the formula $m = -A/B$.

1.  **Slope of Line A (mA)**:
    Equation: $2x - 4y + 5 = 0$
    Here, $A = 2$ and $B = -4$.
    $m_A = -\frac{2}{-4}$
    **$m_A = \frac{1}{2}$** ‚úÖ

2.  **Slope of Line B (mB)**:
    Equation: $x - 2y - 3 = 0$
    Here, $A = 1$ and $B = -2$.
    $m_B = -\frac{1}{-2}$
    **$m_B = \frac{1}{2}$** ‚úÖ

3.  **Comparison**:
    Since $m_A = m_B = \frac{1}{2}$, the slopes are equal. Therefore, the lines represented by the given equations **are parallel**.

**Practice Question 3: Finding the Equation of a Parallel Line**
Q: Find the equation of a line that is parallel to the line $y = 3x - 5$ and passes through the point (2, 7) ‚úçÔ∏è.

**Solution:**
1.  **Determine the slope of the given line**:
    The given line is in the slope-intercept form, $y = mx + c$.
    For $y = 3x - 5$, the slope is $m = 3$.

2.  **Determine the slope of the new line**:
    Since the new line must be parallel to the given line, it must have the same slope.
    So, the slope of the new line is $m_{new} = 3$.

3.  **Use the point-slope form to find the equation of the new line**:
    The point-slope form of a straight line is $(y - y_1) = m(x - x_1)$.
    We have the slope $m_{new} = 3$ and the point $(x_1, y_1) = (2, 7)$.
    Substitute these values into the formula:
    $(y - 7) = 3(x - 2)$

4.  **Simplify the equation**:
    $y - 7 = 3x - 6$
    $y = 3x - 6 + 7$
    **$y = 3x + 1$** ‚úÖ

This is the equation of the line parallel to $y = 3x - 5$ and passing through (2, 7).
