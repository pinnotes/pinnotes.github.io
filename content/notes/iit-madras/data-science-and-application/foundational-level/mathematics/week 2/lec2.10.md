Based on the sources and our conversation, the **General Form** of the equation of a straight line is a powerful representation because it can represent **any straight line**. This includes vertical lines, which some other forms (like the standard slope-intercept form y = mx + c) cannot represent because their slope is undefined.

The **general equation of a line** is given by:
**Ax + By + C = 0**

For this equation to represent a line, the coefficients A and B **cannot be simultaneously equal to 0**.

We can derive conditions for two lines to be parallel or perpendicular using their equations in this general form.

Let's consider two straight lines represented in the general form:
Line 1: A₁x + B₁y + C₁ = 0
Line 2: A₂x + B₂y + C₂ = 0

The sources provide conditions for parallel and perpendicular lines based on the slopes of the lines. For two **non-vertical** lines with slopes m₁ and m₂:
*   They are **parallel** if and only if their slopes are equal (m₁ = m₂).
*   They are **perpendicular** if and only if the product of their slopes is -1 (m₁ * m₂ = -1).

From the general form Ax + By + C = 0, the slope of a non-vertical line (where B ≠ 0) is given by m = -A/B.

The sources also provide conditions directly using the coefficients of the general form for the case where the y-coefficients (B₁ and B₂) are not zero:
Given two straight lines a₁x + b₁y + c₁ = 0 and a₂x + b₂y + c₂ = 0, where b₁, b₂ ̸= 0:

*   The lines are **parallel** to each other, if:
    **a₁ × b₂ = a₂ × b₁**
    This condition is equivalent to the slopes being equal for non-vertical lines: -a₁/b₁ = -a₂/b₂ implies a₁b₂ = a₂b₁.

*   The lines are **perpendicular** to each other, if:
    **a₁ × a₂ = −b₁ × b₂**
    This condition is equivalent to the product of the slopes being -1 for non-vertical lines: (-a₁/b₁) * (-a₂/b₂) = -1 implies a₁a₂ / (b₁b₂) = -1, so a₁a₂ = -b₁b₂.

These conditions from source are stated for lines where the 'b' coefficients (representing B in Ax+By+C=0) are non-zero, thus applying to non-vertical lines. However, the general form Ax + By + C = 0 itself is capable of representing all lines, including horizontal lines (when A=0) and vertical lines (when B=0).
