Drawing on the provided sources and our conversation history, we can delve into the concept of rational numbers.

**Rational numbers** are defined as numbers that can be written in the form **p divided by q (p/q)**, where both **p and q are integers**. In school, these are typically referred to as fractions.

The set of rational numbers is denoted by a special symbol, **Q**, often written with double lines on the sides.

Rational numbers **extend the set of integers**. Every integer is also a rational number because it can be written with a denominator of 1. For instance, the integer 7 can be expressed as 7/1. Thus, the set of integers (**Z**) is a subset of the set of rational numbers (**Q**). Natural numbers (**N**) are a subset of integers, so they are also implicitly included within the rationals.

One notable characteristic of rational numbers is that their **representation is not unique**. For example, the rational number 3/5 is the same as 6/10 or 30/50. You can multiply both the numerator (p) and the denominator (q) by the same non-zero quantity without changing the value of the number. This non-unique representation can be useful, for example, when adding or comparing fractions, as it allows you to find a common denominator.

To represent a rational number in a unique or **canonical way**, the **reduced form** is used. A rational number p/q is in reduced form when its numerator and denominator have **no common factors other than 1**. This is equivalent to saying that the **greatest common divisor (GCD)** of p and q is 1. For example, the reduced form of 18/60 is 3/10, because the GCD of 3 and 10 is 1. The process of finding the reduced form involves cancelling out common factors. This can be seen as a subset of all possible rational number representations.

Arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication can be performed with rational numbers, just as with natural numbers and integers. Division is particularly relevant to the definition of rational numbers; while division of integers doesn't always result in an integer (e.g., 19 divided by 5 cannot be represented as an integer), it can be represented as a rational number (19/5). However, even with rational numbers, division by zero is not defined (implied by the denominator q being an integer, usually non-zero in the context of p/q).

A significant property of rational numbers is their **density**. Unlike integers or natural numbers, which are considered **discrete** because there are "gaps" and you can identify a "next" or "previous" number, the rational numbers are densely packed. Between **any two rational numbers, you can always find another rational number**. A simple way to find such a number is to take the average (mean) of the two rational numbers.

Despite being dense, the set of rational numbers, surprisingly, has the **same cardinality (size) as the set of integers and natural numbers**; they are all **countable**. This means that even though rationals are dense and appear more numerous, you can establish a bijection (a one-to-one correspondence) between the rational numbers and the natural numbers. This is a non-obvious result given the density of rationals compared to the discreteness of integers.

The introduction of rational numbers was necessary because operations like division often result in numbers that are not integers. However, the rational numbers **do not fill up the entire number line**. Numbers exist that cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers. These are called **irrational numbers**. Famous examples include the square root of 2, which cannot be written as p/q, and pi (π). The existence of irrational numbers necessitates the extension of the number system to include all real numbers.

Rational numbers, like other sets of numbers, can be formally described using **set comprehension**. This involves generating possible elements from an existing set (like pairs of integers p and q), filtering them based on a condition (like q not being zero and the pair p,q satisfying GCD(p,q)=1 for reduced form), and potentially transforming them. They can also be viewed in the context of **relations**, for example, every rational number can be seen as a pair of integers (p, q) from the Cartesian product Z × Z.

Rational numbers also appear in other mathematical contexts, such as representing lengths or areas in geometry and in the study of sequences and limits.
