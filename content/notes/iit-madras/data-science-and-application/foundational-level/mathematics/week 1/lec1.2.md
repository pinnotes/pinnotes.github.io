Here's an explanation of rational numbers, presented in a notes format with emojis for easy understanding:

### Rational Numbers (Q) 💭

*   **What are they?**
    *   Rational numbers are numbers that can be written as a **ratio** of two integers.
    *   They are expressed in the form **p/q** ➗, where 'p' and 'q' are both **integers**.
    *   The top number, 'p', is called the **numerator** ⬆️, and the bottom number, 'q', is called the **denominator** ⬇️.
    *   The set of rational numbers is denoted by the symbol **Q**.
        *   💡 The 'Q' stands for quotient, linking to the idea of a ratio.

*   **Extending from other number sets**
    *   Rational numbers **extend natural numbers and integers**.
    *   Every **integer is also a rational number** because it can be written with a denominator of 1 (e.g., 7 can be written as 7/1).

*   **Representation is not unique** 🤔
    *   Unlike integers, the same rational number can be written in **many different ways**.
    *   For example, 3/5 is the same as 6/10, and 30/50.
    *   You can get equivalent fractions by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by the same quantity.
    *   This property is **extremely useful** for arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction, and for comparing two fractions, as it allows you to convert them to equivalent fractions with the same denominator.

*   **Reduced Form (Canonical Form)** 🧩
    *   To have a "best" or **unique way to represent a rational number**, it's often written in its **reduced form**.
    *   In reduced form, the numerator and denominator **have no common factors** other than 1.
    *   This means their **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)** is 1.
    *   Prime factorization can be used to find the GCD and reduce a fraction. For instance, 18/60 reduces to 3/10 because the GCD of 18 and 60 is 6.

*   **Density Property** 🌌
    *   Unlike integers and natural numbers, which are "discrete" (meaning there's a clear "next" or "previous" number with nothing in between, e.g., between 2 and 3, there are no other integers), rational numbers are **dense**.
    *   This means that **between any two distinct rational numbers, you can always find another rational number**.
    *   A simple way to find a rational number between two others is to take their **average** (sum divided by 2).
    *   Because of this density, you **cannot talk about a "next" or "previous" rational number**.

*   **Cardinality (Size of Infinity)** 📏
    *   Despite being dense and seeming "larger" than integers, the set of rational numbers actually has the **same "size" or cardinality** as the set of integers (and natural numbers).
    *   This counter-intuitive fact is demonstrated by finding a **bijection** (a one-to-one and onto mapping) between them, showing that rational numbers can be "counted" or enumerated, even though they are infinite.
