1. Which of the following option(s) is(are) true?



{{< border type="tip" title="Solution" >}}
Based on the sources and our conversation history, we can determine which of the given inequalities between fractions are true by finding a common denominator and comparing the numerators. Rational numbers, which include fractions, can be written in the form p/q. To compare two fractions which have different denominators, there is no way to directly compare them. The only way is to convert them into **equivalent fractions** such that they have the same denominator. A number that is a multiple of both denominators can be used as the common denominator. Once the denominators are the same, you can add the numerators, or in this case, compare them.

Let's evaluate each inequality:

*   **4/7 > 5/8**
    To compare 4/7 and 5/8, we find a common denominator. The product of the denominators, 7 and 8, is 56.
    We convert 4/7 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 56:
    4/7 = (4 * 8) / (7 * 8) = **32/56**.
    We convert 5/8 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 56:
    5/8 = (5 * 7) / (8 * 7) = **35/56**.
    Now we compare the numerators of the equivalent fractions: 32 and 35.
    Since 32 is less than 35, **32/56 < 35/56**.
    Therefore, **4/7 < 5/8**. The given inequality 4/7 > 5/8 is **false**.

*   **17/12 > 7/13**
    To compare 17/12 and 7/13, we find a common denominator. The product of the denominators, 12 and 13, is 156.
    We convert 17/12 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 156:
    17/12 = (17 * 13) / (12 * 13) = **221/156**.
    We convert 7/13 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 156:
    7/13 = (7 * 12) / (13 * 12) = **84/156**.
    Now we compare the numerators of the equivalent fractions: 221 and 84.
    Since 221 is greater than 84, **221/156 > 84/156**.
    Therefore, **17/12 > 7/13**. The given inequality 17/12 > 7/13 is **true**.

*   **7/11 > 8/13**
    To compare 7/11 and 8/13, we find a common denominator. The product of the denominators, 11 and 13, is 143.
    We convert 7/11 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 143:
    7/11 = (7 * 13) / (11 * 13) = **91/143**.
    We convert 8/13 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 143:
    8/13 = (8 * 11) / (13 * 11) = **88/143**.
    Now we compare the numerators of the equivalent fractions: 91 and 88.
    Since 91 is greater than 88, **91/143 > 88/143**.
    Therefore, **7/11 > 8/13**. The given inequality 7/11 > 8/13 is **true**.

*   **15/7 < 5/2**
    To compare 15/7 and 5/2, we find a common denominator. The product of the denominators, 7 and 2, is 14.
    We convert 15/7 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 14:
    15/7 = (15 * 2) / (7 * 2) = **30/14**.
    We convert 5/2 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 14:
    5/2 = (5 * 7) / (2 * 7) = **35/14**.
    Now we compare the numerators of the equivalent fractions: 30 and 35.
    Since 30 is less than 35, **30/14 < 35/14**.
    Therefore, **15/7 < 5/2**. The given inequality 15/7 < 5/2 is **true**.

The inequalities that are true are:
*   **17/12 > 7/13**
*   **7/11 > 8/13**
*   **15/7 < 5/2**
