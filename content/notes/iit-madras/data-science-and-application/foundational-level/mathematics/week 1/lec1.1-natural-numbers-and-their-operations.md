Here's an explanation of natural numbers and their operations in a notes format, designed for ease of understanding with emojis:

### Natural Numbers and Operations 🔢

*   **Natural Numbers (N)**
    *   Natural numbers are primarily used for **counting objects** (e.g., 7 balls ⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️, 7 pencils ✏️✏️✏️✏️✏️✏️✏️).
    *   They are denoted by the symbol **N**.
    *   In this context, the set of natural numbers **includes 0** (i.e., {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...}).
        *   💡 Historically, there can be some confusion in different books about whether 0 is included, but here, it always is.

*   **Arithmetic Operations**
    *   **Addition (+)**:
        *   This operation combines two or more numbers to find their **sum**.
        *   Example: 5 + 2 = 7 ➕.
    *   **Subtraction (-)**:
        *   This operation finds the **difference** between two numbers.
        *   A key point: If you subtract a larger number from a smaller number (e.g., 5 - 6), you go below zero 📉.
        *   This need to represent "less than nothing" led to the **expansion of numbers to include negative numbers**, forming the set of integers.
    *   **Multiplication (×)**:
        *   Multiplication is essentially **repeated addition**.
        *   Example: 7 times 4 means making 4 copies of 7, which is 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 28 ✖️.
        *   Notation: Besides 'x', a dot (e.g., 7 ⋅ 3) or simply writing symbols together (e.g., 'mn' for m times n) can represent multiplication.
        *   **Sign Rule**:
            *   Negative × Positive = Negative (e.g., -7 × 4 = -28).
            *   Negative × Negative = Positive (e.g., -7 × -4 = +28).
            *   If there's an **even** number of minus signs, the result is positive. If there's an **odd** number, it's negative.
    *   **Exponentiation (Powers)**:
        *   Exponentiation is **repeated multiplication**.
        *   **"Squared" (m²)**: Means 'm' multiplied by itself twice (m × m). This term comes from the ability to arrange these items into a square (e.g., 6 × 6 = 36 items forming a 6x6 square) 🟩.
        *   **"Cubed" (m³)**: Means 'm' multiplied by itself three times (m × m × m). This comes from arranging items in a 3D cube (e.g., 3 × 3 × 3 forming a cube) 📦.
        *   **Higher Powers (m^k)**: For powers beyond 3 (like m^4, m^5, etc.), we simply say "m to the power k" or "the kth power of m" because we can't visually imagine objects in more than 3 dimensions to name them accordingly.
    *   **Division (÷)**:
        *   Division is **repeated subtraction**.
        *   Example: 20 mangoes divided among 5 friends (20 ÷ 5 = 4) means you can subtract 5 from 20 exactly 4 times to reach 0 🍎.
        *   **Quotient and Remainder**: If numbers don't divide evenly (e.g., 19 mangoes for 5 friends), you get a **quotient** (the number of times you can divide without a fractional part, e.g., 3) and a **remainder** (what's left over, e.g., 4).
        *   **Modulo Operator (mod)**: This notation (e.g., 19 mod 5 = 4) is used to explicitly state the **remainder** when one number is divided by another.

*   **Factors**
    *   A number 'a' is a **factor** of 'b' if 'b' can be divided by 'a' evenly, leaving **no remainder** (i.e., b mod a = 0).
    *   This also means that 'b' is a **multiple** of 'a'.
    *   Factors usually come in **pairs** (if 'a' divides 'b' 'k' times, then 'k' also divides 'b').
    *   **Perfect Squares**: For numbers that are perfect squares (a number multiplied by itself, e.g., 36 = 6 × 6), the square root (e.g., 6) is a factor whose "pair" is itself, leading to an **odd number of factors**. Numbers that are not perfect squares have an even number of factors.

*   **Prime Numbers**
    *   A **prime number** is a natural number that has **exactly two distinct factors**: 1 and itself.
    *   **1 is not a prime number** because it only has one factor (1 itself).
    *   The **smallest prime number is 2** (factors: 1, 2).
    *   After 2, no other **even numbers can be prime** because they are all multiples of 2.
    *   Numbers that are not prime (and not 1) are called **composite numbers**; they have more than two factors.
    *   Any integer can be **uniquely factorized** into a product of prime numbers (e.g., 12 = 2 × 2 × 3 or 2² × 3) 🧩.
