Drawing on the provided sources, we can discuss natural numbers and the operations performed on them.

Natural numbers are the very basic things used primarily for counting. The set of natural numbers is typically denoted by **N**. In the context of these sources, the set of natural numbers **includes 0**. So, natural numbers are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on. Some books may define natural numbers starting from 1, but whenever these sources discuss natural numbers, 0 is always included.

The normal arithmetic operations that can be done with natural numbers include **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division**. Exponentiation is also mentioned as an operation.

A key concept discussed from a mathematics perspective is whether performing an operation on natural numbers always results in a natural number. This is known as the **closure property**.

*   **Addition (+):** Adding two natural numbers *does* result in a natural number. Addition involves combining two or more numbers.
*   **Subtraction (-):** Subtraction *fails* this test. If a larger number is subtracted from a smaller natural number (e.g., 5 - 6), the result goes below 0. This operation gives the difference between two numbers. This failure of closure for subtraction leads to the necessity of **expanding the scope of numbers to include negative numbers**, resulting in the set of integers.
*   **Multiplication (×):** Multiplying two natural numbers *does* result in a natural number. Multiplication is described as **repeated addition**. For example, m multiplied by n (m × n) means making n copies of m, adding m to itself n times. The multiplication sign is often a cross (x), but can also be represented by a dot or sometimes nothing at all, especially when using symbols for numbers like 'mn'.
*   **Division (÷):** Division is also discussed. It can be thought of as **repeated subtraction**. However, division does not always result in a natural number. For example, 19 divided by 5 cannot be represented as an integer (which includes natural numbers). This leads to the introduction of rational numbers, which are represented as fractions. When dividing integers and not looking at fractions, the focus might be on the quotient or the remainder (modulo). Modulo gives the remainder when one number is divided by another.
*   **Exponentiation:** Exponentiation is described as **repeated multiplication**.

Related concepts also discussed in the context of natural numbers and operations include:

*   **Factors:** A number 'a' is a factor of 'b' if 'b' divided by 'a' has a remainder of 0 (b mod a = 0). This also means 'b' is a multiple of 'a'.
*   **Prime Numbers:** A prime number is a natural number which has **no factors other than 1 and itself**. It must have exactly two factors. The number 1 is not considered a prime number. The first prime number is 2, followed by 3, 5, 7, and so on. After 2, no even numbers can be prime as they are multiples of 2. Every natural number can be uniquely factorized into prime numbers. This is called prime factorization.
*   **Number Line:** Integers, which extend natural numbers, are mentally visualized as forming a sequence on a number line, where numbers increase from left to right. This concept is also applied to visualize real numbers.
