## Question 1

Choose the correct standard form of a quadratic equation with roots $\frac{2}{3}$ and $\frac{10}{3}$.

Multiple choice options:

- $6x^2 - x - 70 = 0$
- $\frac{1}{3}(6x^2 - x - 70) = 0$
- $\frac{1}{6}(6x^2 - x - 7) = 0$
- $(x - \frac{2}{3})(x + \frac{10}{3}) = 0$

## Question 2

Choose the correct option about a with the help of Figure AQ-5.1.

The question includes a graph showing a parabola with the equation $y = a(x + 2)(b - x)$. The graph shows an upward-opening parabola with x-intercepts at $(-2, 0)$ and $(b, 0)$.

Multiple choice options:

- $a > 0$
- $a = 5$
- $a = 0$
- $a < 0$

## Question 3

Choose the set of correct options regarding quadratic functions $p(x) = x^2 - 7x + 10$ and $q(x) = x^2 + 7x + 10$.

Multiple select options (checkboxes):

- $p(x)$ has two roots -5 and -2
- $p(x)$ has two roots 5 and 2
- $q(x)$ has two roots 5 and 2
- $q(x)$ has two roots -5 and -2
