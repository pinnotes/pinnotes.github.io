## Question 1

A stone is thrown with an initial speed u (m/s) as shown in **figure 3**. The height of the stone's trajectory above the ground is $H(t) = -5t^2 + \frac{1}{2}ut$ (where t is the time of flight). If the highest point in air that the stone can reach is 5m above the ground, then calculate the initial speed u.

The question includes a diagram showing the parabolic trajectory of the stone reaching a maximum height of 5 meters.

Multiple choice options:

- 20 m/s
- 10 m/s
- 12 m/s
- 2 m/s
