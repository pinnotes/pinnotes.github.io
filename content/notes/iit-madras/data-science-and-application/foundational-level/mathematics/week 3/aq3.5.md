## Question 4

A football player kicks a football from the ground. The path of the football can be modeled by the function $h(x) = -\frac{1}{12}x^2 + 20$ where x is the horizontal distance, h(x) the height of the football above the ground, when both are measured in feet. Another player jumps and takes header when the slope of the function h(x) is -0.64.

Choose the correct set of options:

Multiple choice options (checkboxes):

- The maximum height reached by the player's head to take the header is 7.2 feet.
- The maximum height achieved by the ball is 20 feet
- The maximum height reached by the player's head to take the header is 9.2 feet.
- None of the above
