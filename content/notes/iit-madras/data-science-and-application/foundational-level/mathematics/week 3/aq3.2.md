## Question 1

The curve on the surface of the banana as shown in Figure 2 can be described using the equation $y = x^2 + 2x + 4$. An ant (shown in blue color in Figure 2) is walking from one end of the banana to the other end. What will be the x-coordinate of the ant's location once it reaches the vertex of its path?

This is a multiple choice question with the following options:

- 1
- 0
- -1
- 0.5

## Question 2

Deb and Ananya bought 20 toys together. From these 20 toys, Deb lost 3 toys and Ananya lost 4 toys. Product of the current number of their toys is 42. Can you form an equation for Deb to know how many toys did he have initially? [Let us assume Deb initially had x number of toys.]

This is a multiple choice question with the following equation options:

- $−x^3 + 13x − 4 = 42$
- $19x − 4 = 42$
- $−x^2 + 19x − 48 = 42$
- $x^2 = 42$

## Question 3

Represent the following problem in the form of an equation: a medicine manufacturer produces y number of vaccines every day. The manufacturing cost of each vaccine is ₹100 plus the number of vaccines manufactured on that day. On a particular day, the total manufacturing cost was ₹10,000. How many vaccines were manufactured on that day?

Multiple choice options:

- $-y^2 + 13y - 4 = 42$
- $19y - 4 = 10000$
- $y^2 + 100y = 10000$
- $y^2 = 100$
