Let's explore **quadratic functions**! ü§© They might sound complex, but they're just a special kind of equation that helps us understand U-shaped curves. Think of them as the mathematical way to describe things like the path of a thrown ball üèà, the shape of a bridge arch üåâ, or even how a company's profit changes with pricing. üìà

### What is a Quadratic Function? ü§î

A **quadratic function** is defined by an equation that looks like this:
$\mathbf{f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c}$

Here's what each part means:
*   `x` is your **variable** (the input).
*   `f(x)` (or `y`) is the **output** value.
*   `a`, `b`, and `c` are **coefficients** (just numbers/constants). üî¢
*   The **most important condition** is that **`a` cannot be zero** (`a ‚â† 0`).
    *   Why? Because if `a` were 0, the `ax¬≤` term would vanish, and you'd be left with `f(x) = bx + c`, which is a **linear function** (a straight line) instead of a quadratic one. The term "quadratic" itself comes from a word meaning "square," referring to the `x¬≤` term.

### The Shape: A Parabola! üé¢

When you plot a quadratic function on a graph, it always forms a distinctive U-shaped curve called a **parabola**. The direction this parabola opens depends on the value of `a`:
*   **If `a > 0` (positive)**: The parabola **opens upwards** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è, like a smile or a U. This means the function will have a **minimum value**.
*   **If `a < 0` (negative)**: The parabola **opens downwards** ‚¨áÔ∏è, like a frown or an inverted U. This means the function will have a **maximum value**.

### Key Features of a Parabola ‚ú®

To really understand and plot a quadratic function, there are a few important points and lines to know:

*   **Axis of Symmetry** üìè: This is a **vertical line** that divides the parabola into two mirror-image halves. If you fold the graph along this line, both sides of the parabola would perfectly match.
    *   The equation for the axis of symmetry is always **`x = -b / 2a`**.
*   **Vertex** üéØ: This is the **most important point** on the parabola! It's where the axis of symmetry intersects the curve.
    *   The **x-coordinate of the vertex** is the same as the axis of symmetry: **`-b / 2a`**.
    *   The **y-coordinate of the vertex** is the **minimum** (if `a > 0`) or **maximum** (if `a < 0`) value of the function. You find it by plugging the x-coordinate of the vertex back into the original function `f(x)`.
    *   Interestingly, the slope of the quadratic function at its vertex is 0, indicating it's the point where the function "turns around" from increasing to decreasing or vice-versa.
*   **Y-intercept** üìà: This is the point where the parabola crosses the y-axis. You find it by setting `x = 0` in the function, which simplifies to `f(0) = c`. So, the y-intercept is `(0, c)`.

### How to Graph a Quadratic Function (Quick Recipe) üç∞

1.  **Find the y-intercept**: Set `x = 0` to get `(0, c)`.
2.  **Find the axis of symmetry**: Use `x = -b / 2a`. Draw this vertical line.
3.  **Find the vertex**: Plug the `x` value from the axis of symmetry into `f(x)` to get the `y` coordinate. Plot this point.
4.  **Use symmetry**: Choose a few `x` values on one side of the axis of symmetry, calculate `f(x)`, and then use the symmetry to find corresponding points on the other side.
5.  **Connect the dots**: Draw a smooth curve through your plotted points.

### Examples of Quadratic Functions üßë‚Äçüè´

#### Example 1: Finding Minimum Value and Range üìâ
Let's consider the function **`f(x) = x¬≤ - 6x + 9`**.

1.  **Identify `a`, `b`, `c`**: Here, `a = 1`, `b = -6`, `c = 9`.
2.  **Determine opening direction**: Since `a = 1` (which is `> 0`), the parabola **opens upwards** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è and will have a **minimum value**.
3.  **Calculate axis of symmetry**:
    `x = -b / 2a = -(-6) / (2 * 1) = 6 / 2 = 3`.
    So, the axis of symmetry is the line `x = 3`.
4.  **Find the vertex**: Plug `x = 3` back into the function:
    `f(3) = (3)¬≤ - 6(3) + 9 = 9 - 18 + 9 = 0`.
    The vertex is at `(3, 0)`. This means the **minimum value of the function is 0**.
5.  **Determine the range**: Since the minimum value is 0 and the parabola opens upwards, the function can take any value from 0 upwards. So, the **range is `f(x) ‚â• 0`** (or `[0, ‚àû)`).

#### Example 2: Maximising Profit in a Business Scenario üí∞
Imagine a tour bus service in Chennai that currently serves 500 customers daily at ‚Çπ40 per person. The owner estimates that for every ‚Çπ4 fare hike, they lose 10 passengers. The company wants to **maximize its income**.

1.  **Define a variable for fare hikes**: Let `x` be the number of ‚Çπ4 fare hikes.
2.  **Formulate the income function**:
    *   New fare per person: `40 + 4x` (initial fare + 4 rupees for each hike) (information from outside the provided excerpt, inferred from context).
    *   New number of passengers: `500 - 10x` (initial passengers - 10 for each hike).
    *   Total Income (I) = (New fare per person) √ó (New number of passengers)
        `I(x) = (40 + 4x)(500 - 10x)` (multiplication of binomials, explained using FOIL method in).
    *   Expanding this gives the quadratic function: `I(x) = -40x¬≤ + 1600x + 20,000`.
3.  **Identify coefficients and opening direction**:
    *   Here, `a = -40`, `b = 1600`, `c = 20,000`.
    *   Since `a = -40` (which is `< 0`), the curve will **open downwards** ‚¨áÔ∏è, meaning a **maximum income is possible**.
4.  **Find the vertex to determine maximum income**: The maximum income will be attained at the vertex.
    *   Axis of symmetry (x-coordinate of vertex): `x = -b / 2a = -1600 / (2 * -40) = -1600 / -80 = 20`.
    *   This means 20 fare hikes (of ‚Çπ4 each) will maximize the income. The optimal fare would be `40 + (4 * 20) = 40 + 80 = ‚Çπ120`.
    *   To find the maximum income (y-coordinate of vertex), plug `x = 20` back into `I(x)`:
        `I(20) = -40(20)¬≤ + 1600(20) + 20,000`
        `I(20) = -40(400) + 32,000 + 20,000`
        `I(20) = -16,000 + 32,000 + 20,000 = 36,000`
    *   So, the company can achieve a maximum daily income of ‚Çπ36,000 by setting the fare at ‚Çπ120 per person. This shows how quadratic equations can be used to solve real-life situations.

### Slope of a Quadratic Function (A little extra!) ‚úçÔ∏è

Unlike a straight line, which has a constant slope, the **slope of a quadratic function is not constant**; it changes at every point along the curve. For `f(x) = ax¬≤ + bx + c`, the slope at any point `x` is given by the formula **`2ax + b`**.
*   When the slope `2ax + b` equals `0`, that's precisely where the function reaches its minimum or maximum value, which corresponds to the x-coordinate of the vertex, `x = -b / 2a`.

### Solutions ‚úÖ

**Solution to Q1:**
For `f(x) = 2x¬≤ + 4x - 6`, we have `a = 2`, `b = 4`, `c = -6`.

a) **Does the parabola open upwards or downwards?**
    *   Since `a = 2` (which is `> 0`), the parabola **opens upwards** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è.
b) **Will the function have a minimum or maximum value?**
    *   Because it opens upwards, the function will have a **minimum value**.
c) **Find the equation of the axis of symmetry.**
    *   `x = -b / 2a`
    *   `x = -4 / (2 * 2) = -4 / 4 = -1`
    *   The axis of symmetry is **`x = -1`**.
d) **Find the coordinates of the vertex.**
    *   The x-coordinate of the vertex is `-1`.
    *   Substitute `x = -1` into `f(x)` to find the y-coordinate:
        `f(-1) = 2(-1)¬≤ + 4(-1) - 6`
        `f(-1) = 2(1) - 4 - 6`
        `f(-1) = 2 - 4 - 6 = -8`
    *   The vertex is at **`(-1, -8)`**.
e) **What is the range of the function?**
    *   Since the function has a minimum value of `-8` (at the vertex) and opens upwards, the `f(x)` values will be `-8` or greater.
    *   The range is **`f(x) ‚â• -8`** (or `[-8, ‚àû)`).

**Solution to Q2:**
For `C(x) = 0.5x¬≤ - 100x + 6000`, we have `a = 0.5`, `b = -100`, `c = 6000`.

a) **Does this cost function have a minimum or maximum cost?**
    *   Since `a = 0.5` (which is `> 0`), the parabola opens upwards, meaning the function will have a **minimum cost**.
b) **How many units (`x`) should be produced to minimize the cost?**
    *   The minimum cost occurs at the x-coordinate of the vertex (axis of symmetry).
    *   `x = -b / 2a`
    *   `x = -(-100) / (2 * 0.5) = 100 / 1 = 100`
    *   To minimize cost, **100 units** should be produced.
c) **What is the minimum daily cost?**
    *   Substitute `x = 100` into `C(x)`:
        `C(100) = 0.5(100)¬≤ - 100(100) + 6000`
        `C(100) = 0.5(10000) - 10000 + 6000`
        `C(100) = 5000 - 10000 + 6000 = 1000`
    *   The minimum daily cost is **¬£1000**.
