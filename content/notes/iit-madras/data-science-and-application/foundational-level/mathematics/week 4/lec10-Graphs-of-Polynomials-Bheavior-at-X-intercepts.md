Let's explore how the graph of a polynomial behaves when it touches or crosses the x-axis, which is where its "zeros" or "x-intercepts" are found! üßê

### Understanding Zeros and Multiplicities üéØ

First, what are **zeros** of a polynomial? They are simply the **values of 'x' for which the polynomial function 'f(x)' equals zero**. Graphically, these are the points where the graph **crosses or touches the x-axis**.

When a polynomial is written in its factored form, such as `f(x) = (x - a)·µê`, the number 'a' is a zero of the polynomial. The **exponent 'm' in this factor is called the multiplicity** of that zero. The multiplicity is essentially **how often that factor is appearing**. The behaviour of the graph at each x-intercept is critically determined by this multiplicity.

### How Graphs Behave at X-Intercepts (Based on Multiplicity) üìà

The graph of a polynomial function exhibits distinct behaviours at its x-intercepts depending on whether the multiplicity of that zero is even or odd.

*   **Even Multiplicity (e.g., 2, 4, 6...)** ‚Ü©Ô∏è‚Ü™Ô∏è
    *   If a zero has an **even multiplicity**, the graph will **touch the x-axis and bounce off**. It will not cross the x-axis at this point.
    *   This behaviour is similar to a quadratic function (like `y = x¬≤`) where the parabola touches the x-axis at its vertex and turns around.
    *   **For higher even powers** (e.g., multiplicity 4, 6), the graph will appear **flatter as it approaches the x-intercept and as it leaves**. Think of it as a "wider bounce".

*   **Odd Multiplicity (e.g., 1, 3, 5...)** ‚û°Ô∏è‚¨ÖÔ∏è
    *   If a zero has an **odd multiplicity**, the graph will **cross or intersect the x-axis**.
    *   If the multiplicity is **1** (a single order zero), the graph will appear almost **linear** as it crosses the x-axis. It's like a straight line passing through the point.
    *   **For higher odd powers** (e.g., multiplicity 3, 5), the graph will still cross the x-axis, but it will appear **flatter as it crosses**. This is often described as an "S-shape" or a "twist" as it passes through the intercept, similar to the graph of `y = x¬≥`. The graph will also appear flatter while approaching the zero and leaving from it.

In summary, the key takeaway is that **even multiplicities lead to a "touch and bounce"** behaviour, while **odd multiplicities lead to a "cross-through"** behaviour, with higher multiplicities causing a "flattening" effect at the intercept.

### Practice Questions üìù

#### Question 1: Identifying Behaviour from Multiplicity
For each given zero and its multiplicity, describe how the graph of the polynomial will behave at that x-intercept.
**(a)** Zero at `x = 4` with multiplicity `1`
**(b)** Zero at `x = -1` with multiplicity `2`
**(c)** Zero at `x = 0` with multiplicity `3`
**(d)** Zero at `x = 2` with multiplicity `4`

#### Question 2: Matching Factors to Graph Behaviour
A polynomial `P(x)` has the following factored form: `P(x) = (x + 3)¬≤ (x - 1) (x - 5)¬≥`.
Describe the behaviour of the graph of `P(x)` at each of its x-intercepts.

#### Question 3: Sketching Based on Multiplicity (Conceptual)
Imagine a polynomial with zeros at `x = -2` (multiplicity 1), `x = 0` (multiplicity 2), and `x = 3` (multiplicity 3).
**(a)** Which x-intercept(s) will the graph cross?
**(b)** Which x-intercept(s) will the graph touch and bounce off?
**(c)** At which x-intercept will the graph appear to flatten as it crosses?

### Solutions to Practice Questions ‚úÖ

#### Solution 1:
**(a)** Zero at `x = 4` with multiplicity `1`.
*   Since the multiplicity is **odd (1)**, the graph will **cross the x-axis** at `x = 4`. It will appear almost linear at this intercept.

**(b)** Zero at `x = -1` with multiplicity `2`.
*   Since the multiplicity is **even (2)**, the graph will **touch the x-axis and bounce off** at `x = -1`.

**(c)** Zero at `x = 0` with multiplicity `3`.
*   Since the multiplicity is **odd (3)**, the graph will **cross the x-axis** at `x = 0`. Due to the higher odd multiplicity (3), the graph will appear **flatter as it crosses** the x-axis compared to a linear crossing.

**(d)** Zero at `x = 2` with multiplicity `4`.
*   Since the multiplicity is **even (4)**, the graph will **touch the x-axis and bounce off** at `x = 2`. Due to the higher even multiplicity (4), the graph will appear **flatter as it approaches and leaves** the x-axis at this point.

#### Solution 2:
The polynomial is `P(x) = (x + 3)¬≤ (x - 1) (x - 5)¬≥`. Let's identify the zeros and their multiplicities:
*   **Zero at `x = -3`**: The factor is `(x + 3)¬≤`. The multiplicity is **2** (even).
    *   **Behaviour**: At `x = -3`, the graph will **touch the x-axis and bounce off**.
*   **Zero at `x = 1`**: The factor is `(x - 1)`. The multiplicity is **1** (odd).
    *   **Behaviour**: At `x = 1`, the graph will **cross the x-axis**, appearing almost linear at the intercept.
*   **Zero at `x = 5`**: The factor is `(x - 5)¬≥`. The multiplicity is **3** (odd).
    *   **Behaviour**: At `x = 5`, the graph will **cross the x-axis**. Due to the higher odd multiplicity (3), it will appear **flatter as it crosses** the x-axis.

#### Solution 3:
A polynomial with zeros at `x = -2` (multiplicity 1), `x = 0` (multiplicity 2), and `x = 3` (multiplicity 3).

**(a)** Which x-intercept(s) will the graph cross?
*   The graph will cross at zeros with odd multiplicities.
*   Therefore, it will cross at **`x = -2` (multiplicity 1)** and **`x = 3` (multiplicity 3)**.

**(b)** Which x-intercept(s) will the graph touch and bounce off?
*   The graph will touch and bounce off at zeros with even multiplicities.
*   Therefore, it will touch and bounce off at **`x = 0` (multiplicity 2)**.

**(c)** At which x-intercept will the graph appear to flatten as it crosses?
*   Flattening at crossing occurs with higher odd multiplicities.
*   Therefore, the graph will appear to flatten as it crosses at **`x = 3` (multiplicity 3)**.

This understanding of multiplicity is a powerful tool for sketching polynomial graphs and interpreting them visually! üé®
