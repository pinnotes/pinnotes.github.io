### 💡 Tips for Remembering

- **Viral diseases** often cause leaf color changes or deformities (think: mosaic, curly, yellowing).
- **Bacterial diseases** usually lead to spots, wilting, or rotting.
- **Fungal diseases** feature mildews, rusts, rots, and blights.
- **Nematode diseases** affect roots, causing knots or lesions.
