## 🧪 SSC CHSL Chemistry Study Material – Easy Guide with Emojis

Here's a simple, emoji-filled summary of the key Chemistry concepts from your SSC CHSL PDF[^1]:

---

### 🌌 **Matter \& Its States**

- **Matter** is anything that has mass and takes up space (except: heat, light, electricity, sound, magnetism, vacuum, shadow).
- **Particles of matter** are tiny, have spaces between them, and are always moving (kinetic energy 💨).
- **Intermolecular force**: Strongest in solids 🧱, weaker in liquids 💧, weakest in gases 💨.


#### **States of Matter**

- 🧱 **Solid**: Fixed shape \& volume, particles packed tightly, not compressible.
- 💧 **Liquid**: No fixed shape, fixed volume, particles move more freely.
- 💨 **Gas**: No fixed shape or volume, particles move freely, highly compressible.
- 🌟 **Plasma**: Super-energized, ionized gas (found in stars, neon signs).
- ❄️ **Bose-Einstein Condensate**: Super-cooled, low-density gas where atoms act as one quantum state.

---

### 🔬 **Atoms \& Molecules**

- **Atom**: Smallest part of an element that can take part in a chemical reaction.
    - Example: Hydrogen atom is the smallest.
- **Atomic mass**: Measured in atomic mass units (u), based on carbon-12.
- **Molecule**: Group of two or more atoms bonded together (can be same or different elements).
- **Atomicity**: Number of atoms in a molecule.
- **Ion**: Charged particle.
    - Positive = Cation ➕
    - Negative = Anion ➖

---

### ⚖️ **Laws of Chemistry**

- **Law of Conservation of Mass**: Mass is neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction.
- **Law of Constant Proportions**: Elements in a compound are always in fixed ratios by mass.

---

### 🧑‍🔬 **Atomic Models**

- **Dalton’s Atomic Theory**:
    - All matter is made of atoms.
    - Atoms can't be created/destroyed.
    - Atoms of the same element are identical.
- **Thomson’s Model**: "Plum pudding" – electrons in a positive sphere.
- **Rutherford’s Model**: Tiny nucleus (positive), electrons revolve around it.
- **Bohr’s Model**: Electrons in energy levels (shells: K, L, M, N...).

---

### 🧩 **Subatomic Particles**

- **Electron (e⁻)**: Discovered by J.J. Thomson, negative charge.
- **Proton (p⁺)**: Discovered by Goldstein, positive charge.
- **Neutron (n⁰)**: Discovered by Chadwick, neutral.

---

### 🧮 **Key Atomic Terms**

- **Atomic Number (Z)**: Number of protons.
- **Mass Number (A)**: Protons + Neutrons.
- **Isotopes**: Same atomic number, different mass (e.g., Hydrogen: Protium, Deuterium, Tritium).
- **Isobars**: Same mass number, different atomic number (e.g., Argon-40 \& Calcium-40).
- **Isotones**: Same number of neutrons.

---

### 🧪 **Chemical Formulae \& Valency**

- **Chemical formula**: Shows which elements and how many atoms are in a compound.
- **Valency**: Combining capacity of an element (number of electrons lost, gained, or shared).

---

### 🧬 **Molecular Mass \& Avogadro’s Number**

- **Molecular mass**: Sum of atomic masses in a molecule (e.g., H₂O = 2×1 + 16 = 18u).
- **Avogadro’s constant**: $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ (number of atoms in 12g of carbon-12).

---

### 💡 **Fun Facts \& Exceptions**

- **Diffusion**: Mixing of particles; fastest in gases, slowest in solids.
- **Rubber band**: Can stretch (solid with flexibility).
- **Sponge**: Solid but compressible due to air holes.
- **Plasma**: Found in stars, neon lights.
- **BEC**: Predicted by S.N. Bose \& Einstein, at ultra-low temperatures.

### 📝 **Quick Reference Table**

| State | Shape | Volume | Compressible | Example |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 🧱 Solid | Fixed | Fixed | No | Ice, Iron |
| 💧 Liquid | No | Fixed | Slightly | Water, Oil |
| 💨 Gas | No | No | Yes | Oxygen, Steam |
| 🌟 Plasma | No | No | Yes | Sun, Neon Signs |
| ❄️ BEC | No | No | Yes | Ultra-cold gases |
