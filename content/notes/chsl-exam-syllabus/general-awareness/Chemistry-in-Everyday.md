## 🧪 Chemistry in Everyday Life (SSC CHSL Study Material)

Here’s an easy-to-understand summary of the key concepts from the provided PDF, with emojis to help you remember important points:

---

### 🍔 Chemicals in Food

- **Colouring agents** 🎨: Make food look appealing.
- **Artificial preservatives** 🧴: Prevent food spoilage by stopping microorganism growth (e.g., Sodium benzoate, sodium meta bisulphate).
- **Flow stabilizers** 💧: Maintain consistency.
- **Binding substances** 🪢: Hold ingredients together.
- **Artificial sweeteners** 🍬: Add sweetness without calories (e.g., Aspartame in cool drinks/ice-cream, Alitame is 2000x sweeter than sugar).
- **Antioxidants** 🛡️: Prevent food oxidation/spoilage (e.g., BHT, BHA).
- **Minerals \& Vitamins** 💊: Only vitamins have nutritional value.

---

### 🧴 Artificial Preservatives

- Stop food spoilage by preventing microorganism growth.
- **Examples:** Sodium benzoate, sodium meta bisulphate.

---

### 🍭 Artificial Sweeteners

- No calories, excreted via urine.
- **Aspartame:** Used in cool drinks and ice-creams.
- **Alitame:** 2000x sweeter than sugar.

---

### 🛡️ Antioxidants

- Prevent oxidation (spoilage) of food.
- **Examples:** BHT, BHA.

---

### 🎨 Dyes

- Used to color paper, leather, fur, hair, drugs, cosmetics.
- **Types:** Natural dyes \& Synthetic dyes.

---

### 🧼 Chemistry of Cleansing Agents

**Soaps** 🧼:

- Sodium or potassium salts of higher carboxylic acids (e.g., stearic acid, palmitic acid).
- Made via **saponification** (alkaline hydrolysis of glycerol triesters).
- Don’t work in hard water (form precipitate).

**How soaps work:**

- Have hydrophobic (water-hating) and hydrophilic (water-loving) parts.
- Hydrophobic end sticks to dirt, hydrophilic end to water. When rinsed, dirt washes away.

**Types of Soaps:**

- **Toilet soaps** 🚽: Potassium-based, softer.
- **Floating soaps** 🫧: Made by beating soap bubbles.
- **Transparent soaps** 🫙: Soap dissolved in excess alcohol, then evaporated.
- **Medicated soaps** 🩹: Contain Dettol, Savlon, etc.
- **Laundry soaps** 🧺: Contain sodium rosinate, borax.

**Detergents** 🧴:

- Work in hard water.
- **Types:**
    - **Anionic detergents:** Anion is active (e.g., Sodium Lauryl Sulphate).
    - **Cationic detergents:** Cation is active (e.g., Cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide).
    - **Non-ionic detergents:** Whole molecule is active (e.g., Polyethylene glycol stearate).

---

### 💄 Chemistry of Cosmetics

- **Emulsifiers** 🥄: Stabilize mixtures (e.g., Potassium cetyl sulfate).
- **Preservatives** 🧴: Increase shelf life (e.g., benzyl alcohol, salicylic acid).
- **Thickeners** 🧈: Give appealing texture (e.g., cetyl alcohol, stearic acid).
- **Emollients** 🧴: Soften skin by preventing water loss (e.g., glycerine, zinc oxide).
- **Glimmer \& Shiners** ✨: Add shine (e.g., mica, bismuth oxychloride).

---

### 💧 Bottled Water Expiry

- **Why expiry date?** To ensure packaging quality.
- **After expiry:** Taste may change due to chemicals leaching from packaging.

---

### 🧬 Elements in the Human Body

- **Water:** 60% of body.
- **Main elements:** Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, Oxygen (96% of body).
- **Others:** Calcium, phosphorus, potassium, sulphur, etc.

---

### 🌞 Sun Protection

- **UV-A \& UV-B rays** are harmful.
- **Sunscreen:** Acts as a screen, protects mainly from UV-B (prevents sunburn).
- **Sunblock:** Reflects both UV-A \& UV-B.
