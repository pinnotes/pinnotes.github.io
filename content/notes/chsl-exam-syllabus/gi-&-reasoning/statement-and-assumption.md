## Statement and Assumption: Detailed Explanation

**Statement and Assumption** is a core topic in logical reasoning, frequently featured in government and competitive exams. It tests your ability to analyze a given statement and determine which underlying assumptions are logically implied by it[^1][^3][^2].

---

### **Key Concepts**

- **Statement:** A single sentence or a set of sentences presenting a fact, opinion, or situation.
- **Assumption:** An unstated premise that is taken for granted in the statement. It is something the author believes to be true in order for the statement to make sense.
- **Implicit Assumption:** Not directly stated but necessary for the statement to be valid.
- **Explicit Assumption:** Directly stated in the statement (rare in reasoning questions).

---

### **Types of Assumptions**

- **Direct Assumptions:** These are straightforward and can be easily inferred from the statement.
    - **Example:**
        - **Statement:** "An apple a day keeps the doctor away."
        - **Assumption I:** "Apple is good for health."
        - **Assumption II:** "Apple is not good for health."
        - **Correct Answer:** Only Assumption I is practical[^1].
- **Indirect Assumptions:** These require deeper understanding and interpretation of the statement.
    - **Example:**
        - **Statement:** "The only possible way of getting success is to treat everything that comes on your way positively."
        - **Assumption I:** "If you score low marks in any exam, instead of cursing yourself, you should find the faults and just work upon them hard."
        - **Assumption II:** "Whatever will happen to you, all depends upon your luck. You have no role to play in it."
        - **Correct Answer:** Only Assumption I is practical[^1].

### **How to Solve Statement and Assumption Questions**

1. **Read the Statement Carefully:** Understand the context and meaning.
2. **Analyze Each Assumption:** Check if the assumption is necessary for the statement to be true.
3. **Identify Implicit Assumptions:** Choose assumptions that are not explicitly stated but are logically required.
4. **Eliminate Irrelevant Assumptions:** Discard assumptions that are not connected or contradict the statement.
5. **Do Not Overcomplicate:** Stick to the information given in the statement. Do not bring in outside knowledge unless it is a common assumption[^1][^3][^2].

---

### **Rules and Tips**

- **An assumption must be implicit in the statement.**
- **An assumption cannot be the opposite of the statement.**
- **An assumption cannot be more specific than the statement.**
- **An assumption cannot be a personal opinion or belief.**
- **Use the elimination method to narrow down options[^6][^5].**

## **Solved Examples**

### **Example 1: Direct Assumption**

**Statement:**
The advisable age for a child to join a school is 5 years.

**Assumptions:**
I. At this age, the child is familiar to adaptability.
II. After this age, kids do not like to go to school.
III. Schools do not take admission of children who are more than 5 years old.

**Answer:** Only Assumption I follows[^1][^3].

**Explanation:**
The statement suggests that 5 years is the best age for adaptability, not that children cannot join after 5 or that schools refuse older children.

---

### **Example 2: Indirect Assumption**

**Statement:**
Food poisoning due to the consumption of liquor is very common in rural areas.

**Assumptions:**
I. There are more illegal and unauthorized shops selling liquor in villages and rural areas.
II. The ratio of people drinking liquor in villages is much more than that in towns.

**Answer:** Only Assumption I follows[^1].

**Explanation:**
The statement talks about food poisoning due to liquor, not about the number of people drinking. Assumption I is relevant as it explains the cause of food poisoning.

---

### **Example 3: Doctor’s Advice**

**Statement:**
Divya was advised by the Doctor that she should not take part in the dance competition.

**Assumptions:**
I. The Doctor did not want Divya to take part in the competition because he was afraid that she might lose.
II. Divya had major surgery because of her injury.
III. Divya did not have the money to go for the auditions.

**Answer:** Assumption II follows but Assumption I and III do not follow[^1].

**Explanation:**
The doctor would only advise against participation if there is a health reason, such as surgery.

---

### **Example 4: Election Scenario**

**Statement:**
In an election conducted in Village X, only 20% of the total number of women in the village came to vote.

**Assumptions:**
I. The number of men in the village is more than the number of women in the village X.
II. Women had to cook food and could not come to vote.

**Answer:** Neither Assumption I nor Assumption II follows[^1].

**Explanation:**
The statement gives no information about the number of men or the reason women did not vote.

---

### **Example 5: School Summer Camp**

**Statement:**
The school has decided to cancel the summer camp this year.

**Assumptions:**
I. No entries have been received by the Institution for students willing to join the summer camp.
II. It is being cancelled because the weather is too hot.

**Answer:** Only Assumption I follows[^1][^3].

**Explanation:**
The camp is usually held in summer, so the weather is not a valid reason for cancellation. Lack of entries is a logical assumption.
