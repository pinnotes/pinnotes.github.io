Below is a detailed explanation of the **Mirror and Water Image** concepts based on your PDF, including core principles, solved examples, and practice questions for both mirror and water images[^1][^2][^4].

## Detailed Explanation: Mirror and Water Images

### **Mirror Image**

**Definition:**
A mirror image is the reflection of an object formed when a mirror is placed in front of it. This results in lateral inversion, meaning the left and right sides of the object are swapped, but the top and bottom remain the same[^2][^4][^5].

**Key Points:**

- **Lateral Inversion:** Left becomes right and right becomes left.
- **Symmetry:** The original figure and its mirror image together form a symmetrical shape.
- **Letters and Numbers:** Some letters (e.g., A, H, I, M, O, T, U, V, W, X, Y) and numbers (e.g., 0, 8) have mirror images that look the same as the original[^1][^2].
- **Clock Images:** The mirror image of a clock time can be calculated by subtracting the given time from 11:60 or 12:00 (using 11:60 for minutes, e.g., 9:30 becomes 2:30)[^1][^4].

**Example:**

- **Word:** "FUN"
    - **Mirror Image:** The letters are reversed left to right. The correct mirror image is often represented as "NUF" or as a stylized reversed version if fonts are considered.
- **Figure:** If a heart is cut vertically and a mirror is placed along the cut, the half and its reflection form the complete heart.

### **Water Image**

**Definition:**
A water image is the reflection of an object seen on the surface of water, resulting in a vertical inversion (upside down), but the left and right sides remain the same[^1][^2][^5].

**Key Points:**

- **Vertical Inversion:** Top becomes bottom and bottom becomes top.
- **Letters and Numbers:** Some letters (e.g., C, D, E, H, I, K, O, X) and numbers (e.g., 0, 3, 8) have water images that look the same as the original[^1].
- **Clock Images:** The water image of a clock time can be calculated by subtracting the given time from 18:30 (or 17:90 if minutes exceed 30)[^3][^4].

**Example:**

- **Word:** "FROG"
    - **Water Image:** Each letter is inverted vertically. "F" becomes "E", "R" becomes "B", "O" remains "O", "G" becomes "C". The correct water image is "EBOC".
- **Figure:** If a figure is placed above water, its water image is the upside-down version.

## **Solved Examples**

### **Mirror Image Examples**

1. **Word: "TRIUMPHS"**
    - **Mirror Image:** The letters are reversed left to right. The correct option is a stylized reversed version[^1].
2. **Number: "2345"**
    - **Mirror Image:** The digits are reversed left to right. The correct option is "S E Z S" (using stylized digits).
3. **Clock:**
    - **Mirror shows 9:30**
    - **Actual Time:** Subtract from 11:60 (or 12:00):
$11:60 - 9:30 = 2:30$
**Answer:** 2:30[^1][^4].

### **Water Image Examples**

1. **Word: "TOP"**
    - **Water Image:** "TOP" becomes "LOb" (each letter is inverted vertically).
2. **Number: "96FSH52"**
    - **Water Image:** Each character is inverted vertically. The correct option is a stylized version of the inverted characters.
3. **Clock:**
    - **Given Time: 8:15**
    - **Water Image Time:** Subtract from 18:30
$18:30 - 8:15 = 10:15$
**Answer:** 10:15[^3][^4].

## **Summary Table**

| Concept | What Changes | What Stays Same | Example (Word) | Example (Clock) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Mirror Image | Left ↔ Right | Top, Bottom | "FUN" → "NUF" | 9:30 → 2:30 |
| Water Image | Top ↔ Bottom | Left, Right | "TOP" → "LOb" | 8:15 → 10:15 |

## **Tips for Solving**

- **Mirror Image:** Swap left and right sides.
- **Water Image:** Flip the object upside down.
- **Clock Problems:**
    - **Mirror:** Subtract from 11:60 (or 12:00).
    - **Water:** Subtract from 18:30 (or 17:90 if minutes > 30).
- **Practice with letters, numbers, and figures to master both concepts[^1][^2][^4].**
