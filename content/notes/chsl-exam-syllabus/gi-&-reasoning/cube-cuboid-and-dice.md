## Cube, Cuboid, and Dice: Easy Study Material with Emojis and Practice Questions 🎲📐


---

### **1. Cube Basics** 🧊

- A **cube** is a 3D shape with **all sides equal**: length = width = height = *s*.
- It has:
    - **6 faces** (front, back, right, left, top, bottom)
    - **8 vertices** (corners)
    - **12 edges** (lines connecting vertices)

---

### **2. Surface Area of Cube** 📏

- **Total Surface Area (TSA)** = 6 × (side × side) = $6s^2$
- **Lateral Surface Area (LSA)** = 4 × (side × side) = $4s^2$
(Sum of 4 side faces, excluding top and bottom)

---

### **3. Cuboid Basics** 📦

- A **cuboid** is a 3D shape with **length (l), width (w), height (h)** all possibly different.
- It has:
    - 6 rectangular faces
    - 8 vertices
    - 12 edges
- **Total Surface Area (TSA)** = Sum of areas of all 6 faces = $2(lw + lh + wh)$
- **Lateral Surface Area (LSA)** = Sum of 4 side faces (excluding top and bottom)

---

### **4. Unit Cubes and Painted Surfaces** 🎨

- When a cube is divided into smaller cubes, these are called **unit cubes**.
- Example: Dividing a cube into 3 rows × 3 columns × 3 layers = 27 unit cubes.

| Rows per side | Total Unit Cubes |
| :-- | :-- |
| 2 | 8 |
| 3 | 27 |
| 4 | 64 |
| 5 | 125 |
| 6 | 216 |
| 7 | 343 |


---

### **5. Painted Unit Cubes: How Many Have How Many Painted Faces?** 🎨

For a cube divided into $n \times n \times n$ unit cubes:


| Painted Faces | Number of Unit Cubes |
| :-- | :-- |
| 3 faces painted | 8 (always the 8 corner cubes) |
| 2 faces painted | $12 \times (n - 2)$ (cubes on edges) |
| 1 face painted | $6 \times (n - 2)^2$ (cubes on faces) |
| 0 faces painted | $(n - 2)^3$ (cubes inside, no paint) |


---

### **6. Practice Questions: Painted Cubes** 🧩

A cube of side 10 cm is painted red with a 2 cm wide green strip along all sides on all faces. It is divided into 125 smaller cubes.

1. **How many cubes have 3 green faces?**
    - Answer: 8 (corner cubes) 🟩🟩🟩
2. **How many cubes have 1 red face and 1 adjacent green face?**
    - Answer: 0 (green cubes have at least 2 faces painted) ❌
3. **How many cubes have at least one face coloured?**
    - Total cubes = 125
    - Cubes with no paint = 27
    - Painted cubes = 125 - 27 = 98 ✅
4. **How many cubes have at least 2 green faces?**
    - Painted cubes - cubes with only red paint - cubes with no paint = 44 ✅

---

### **7. Dice Basics** 🎲

- A **dice** is a cube with numbers 1 to 6 on its faces.
- **Opposite faces always add up to 7**:
    - 1 opposite 6
    - 2 opposite 5
    - 3 opposite 4

---

### **8. Types of Dice** 🎲

- **Standard Dice**: When two dice are rolled, numbers on faces do not match.
- **Ordinary Dice**: One or more numbers match between two dice.

---

### **9. Rules for Dice Problems** 🎲🔄

- **Rule 1:** If two dice share a common number on the same face, remaining faces are opposite.
- **Rule 2:** If two dice share two numbers anywhere, the third numbers are opposite.
- **Rule 3:** If one number is common but in different positions, rotate dice clockwise to find opposite faces.

---

### **10. Open Dice (Flattened Dice)** 🟥⬜

- Opposite faces never touch each other.
- Common opposite pairs vary, e.g.:
    - 1 opposite 6
    - 2 opposite 5
    - 3 opposite 4

---

### **11. Practice Questions: Dice** 🎲

1. **Possible combinations of dice?**
    - Only option 3 is possible based on adjacency and opposition rules.
2. **Opposite side to face with 3 dots?**
    - Answer: 6 (since 4,5,2 are adjacent to 3).
3. **Choose dice similar to the given open die:**
    - Answer: Figures 1 and 3.
4. **Dots opposite to face with 4 dots?**
    - Answer: 2.
5. **If 4 is at the bottom, what number is on top?**
    - Answer: 1.
6. **If 1 is adjacent to 2,3,5, which is necessarily true?**
    - Answer: 4 is adjacent to 6.

## Visualize \& Practice! 🎯

- Draw cubes and mark painted faces to understand unit cubes with different painted sides.
- Practice dice problems by sketching dice nets (open dice) and folding them mentally.
- Use the rules to check opposites and adjacency on dice.
