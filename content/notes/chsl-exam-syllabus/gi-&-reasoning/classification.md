## Classification Reasoning: Easy Study Material with Emojis

### **What is Classification?** 🧐

Classification means grouping items based on a common quality and spotting the one that doesn't fit—the "odd one out." These questions can involve words, letters, numbers, or figures. Your task is to find the item that is different from the rest based on a hidden logic or property[^1][^2].
