## Detailed Explanation of Classification

**What is Classification?**

Classification is the process of grouping items based on a common characteristic and identifying the one item that does not belong. This skill is widely used in reasoning and aptitude tests, where you are given a set of words, letters, numbers, or figures, and you must spot the odd one out or identify the pair with a different relationship[^2][^4].
