Here is a detailed explanation of **Syllogism** as presented in your attached PDF, complete with step-by-step examples and practice questions to help you master this reasoning topic[^1][^3][^4].

## What is Syllogism?

**Syllogism** is a form of logical reasoning where you use two or more statements (premises) to reach a valid conclusion. In competitive exams, you are usually given two or three statements and a set of conclusions. You must decide which conclusions logically follow from the statements, treating the statements as 100% true even if they contradict common knowledge[^1][^4].

---

## Key Concepts and Rules

### **1. Types of Statements in Syllogism**

- **All A are B:** Every A is included in B.
- **Some A are B:** At least one A is also B.
- **No A is B:** No overlap between A and B.
- **Some A are not B:** At least one A is not B.


### **2. Venn Diagram Approach**

- **All A are B:**
    - **Diagram:** Circle A entirely inside Circle B.
- **Some A are B:**
    - **Diagram:** Circles A and B overlap.
- **No A is B:**
    - **Diagram:** Circles A and B do not touch.
- **Some A are not B:**
    - **Diagram:** Part of Circle A is outside Circle B.


### **3. Rules for Definite Conclusions**

- **A conclusion must be 100% true to be accepted.**
- **If a conclusion is false in any possible Venn diagram, it is considered false.**
- **Negative conclusions are only valid if there is a negative statement in the premises.**
- **If all statements are positive, negative conclusions are false.**


### **4. Either-Or Case**

- **Formed when two conclusions are complementary and neither is definitely true.**
- **Complementary pairs:**
    - **Some + No**
    - **All + Some not**
- **Both conclusions must have the same subject and predicate (can interchange for "Some + No").**


### **5. Possibility Case**

- **If a conclusion is possible (not definitely true or false), it is only accepted if the question asks for possibility.**
- **Keywords: "can be", "possibility", "may be"**


### **6. New Keywords**

- **All, Each, Every, Only, 100%:** Use "All".
- **Some, Almost, Little, Few, At most, At least, Many, Mostly, 1-99%:** Use "Some".
- **None, 0%:** Use "No".

## Solved Examples

### **Example 1: Definite Conclusion**

**Statements:**

- No panda is dog.
- Some panda is crow.
- All dogs are animal.

**Conclusions:**
I. Some dog are crow.
II. Some crow are panda.
III. Some animal are not panda.

**Solution:**

- **Conclusion I:** False (no direct relation).
- **Conclusion II:** True (some panda are crow).
- **Conclusion III:** True (all dogs are animal and no dog is panda).

**Answer:** Only II and III follow[^1].

---

### **Example 2: Either-Or Case**

**Statements:**

- Some wicket are green.
- Some wicket are dry.
- No green is pitch.

**Conclusions:**
I. Some dry are pitch.
II. Some pitch are not green.
III. No pitch is dry.

**Solution:**

- **Conclusion I:** False (no direct relation).
- **Conclusion II:** True (no green is pitch, so some pitch are not green).
- **Conclusion III:** False (no direct relation).

**Either-Or:** I and III are complementary ("Some + No").
**Answer:** Either I or III, and II follow[^1].

---

### **Example 3: Possibility Case**

**Statements:**

- Only a few doctors are teachers.
- No teacher is a lawyer.
- No lawyer is a scientist.

**Conclusions:**
I. Some teachers can be scientist is a possibility.
II. Some doctors are not lawyers.

**Solution:**

- **Conclusion I:** True (possibility).
- **Conclusion II:** True (some doctors are teachers and no teacher is lawyer).

**Answer:** Both I and II follow[^1].

---

### **Example 4: New Keywords**

**Statements:**

- Some tables are chairs.
- Only a few chairs are sofas.
- No sofa is a cupboard.

**Conclusions:**
I. Some chairs are not sofa.
II. All table can be cupboard is a possibility.
III. No chair is a cupboard.

**Solution:**

- **Conclusion I:** True ("only a few" means some are, some are not).
- **Conclusion II:** True (possibility).
- **Conclusion III:** False (not definite).

**Answer:** Only I and II follow[^1].

---

### **Example 5: Reverse Syllogism**

**Conclusions:**
I. No real is fake.
II. All fake can be a man.

**Statements:**

1. All papers are fake. No fake is pen. All real is fake. All pens are man.
2. All papers are fake. No fake is pen. All real are pen. All pens are man.
3. Some papers are fake. No fake is man. All real are pen. All pens are man.
4. Some papers are fake. No fake is pen. All real is fake. All pens are man.
5. All papers are fake. No fake is man. All real are pen. All pens are man.

**Solution:**

- **Statement 2:**
    - **Conclusion I:** True (all real are pen, no fake is pen).
    - **Conclusion II:** True (possibility).

**Answer:** Both conclusions can be derived from statement set 2[^1].

### **Example 6: Coded Syllogism**

**Statement:** Ww \$ Pp !Uu * Rr ~ Tt
**Meaning:**

- "A\$B" = All A are B
- "A!B" = All B are A
- "A*B" = Some A are B
- "A~B" = No A is B

**Decoded:** All Ww are Pp. All Uu are Pp. Some Uu are Rr. No Rr is Tt.

**Conclusions:**
I. Some Ww are Tt.
II. All Uu are Tt.
III. Some Pp are Rr.

**Solution:**

- **Conclusion I:** False (no direct relation).
- **Conclusion II:** False (some Uu are Rr, no Rr is Tt).
- **Conclusion III:** True (some Uu are Rr, Uu are Pp).

**Answer:** Only III follows[^1].

## Practice Questions

**Directions:** In each question below are given three statements followed by two conclusions. You have to take the given statements to be true even if they seem to be at variance with commonly known facts. Read all the conclusions and then decide which of the given conclusions logically follows from the given statements.
