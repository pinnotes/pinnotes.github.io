## Coding-Decoding: Easy Study Material with Emojis 🚦


---

### **What is Coding-Decoding?** 🧩

- **Coding**: Changing a word or message into a secret code using rules or patterns.
- **Decoding**: Changing the code back into the original word or message[^1].

---

### **Key Concepts \& Tricks** 🗝️

#### **1. Positional Value of Alphabets** 🔤

- **Forward**: A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26
- **Reverse**: Z=1, Y=2, ..., A=26
- **Memory Tip**: "EJOTY" helps you remember 5, 10, 15, 20, 25[^1].


#### **2. Letter to Letter Coding** 📝

- Letters are changed using operations like addition, subtraction, or interchanging.
- **Trick**:
    - Check for opposite letters (A↔Z, B↔Y, etc.).
    - Check for position changes or arithmetic operations[^1].


#### **3. Letter to Number Coding** 🔢

- Assign numbers to letters based on their position or a set rule.
- Sometimes, numbers are manipulated (added, multiplied, etc.)[^1].


#### **4. Substitutional Coding** 🔄

- Words are replaced with other words.
- Find the answer by tracing the chain of substitutions[^1].


#### **5. Chinese (Statement) Coding** 🈲

- Words in statements are coded with symbols/words/letters.
- Find the code by matching common words in different statements[^1].


#### **6. LSN (Letter, Symbol, Number) Coding** 🔣

- Words are coded using a mix of letters, symbols, and numbers.
- Each part (first/last letter, word length) has a coding rule[^1].


#### **7. Conditional Coding** ⚡

- Coding depends on specific conditions (e.g., first/last letter is a vowel/consonant).
- Apply all conditions step by step[^1].


#### **8. Clock Coding** 🕒

- Numbers or symbols represent time (hours/minutes).
- Sometimes, binary codes (A=0, B=1) are used for numbers[^1].

### **Step-by-Step Tricks to Crack Coding-Decoding** 🧠

1. **Check for Opposite Letters**:
    - E.g., A↔Z, B↔Y, C↔X...
2. **Check for Position Interchange**:
    - Are letters swapped or reversed?
3. **Check for Arithmetic Operations**:
    - Addition, subtraction, multiplication on letter positions or numbers.
4. **Check for Substitution**:
    - Is a word replaced by another? Follow the chain!
5. **For Number Codes**:
    - Are numbers the sum of letter positions? Or squares/cubes of word length?

### **Practice Questions with Detailed Solutions** 📝✨


---

#### **Q1.**

If "ENGLISH" is coded as "FOHNHRG", how is "SCIENCE" coded?

**Solution:**
Apply the same pattern as for "ENGLISH" (each letter is shifted forward by 1):
S → T, C → D, I → J, E → G, N → M, C → B, E → D
So, "SCIENCE" = **TDJGMBD**[^1]
**Answer:** TDJGMBD ✍️

---

#### **Q2.**

If "FRIEND" is written as "UIRVMW", how is "TRADER" coded?

**Solution:**
Each letter is replaced by its opposite in the alphabet:
T↔G, R↔I, A↔Z, D↔W, E↔V, R↔I
So, "TRADER" = **GIZWVI**[^1]
**Answer:** GIZWVI 🔄

---

#### **Q3.**

If "GIVE" is "810236" and "BOND" is "316155", how is "CREW" coded?

**Solution:**
Each letter is assigned a specific number based on a pattern (see example).
C=4, R=19, E=5, W=23, sum or pattern applied as per the code.
Following the pattern: **419624**[^1]
**Answer:** 419624 🔢

---

#### **Q4.**

If "Y" = 50 and "SEA" = 50, what is "YACHT"?

**Solution:**
Y=25; 25×2=50.
SEA: (19+5+1)×2=50.
YACHT: (25+1+3+8+20)×2 = 57×2 = **114**[^1]
**Answer:** 114 🚤

---

#### **Q5.**

If "eye" is called "hand", "hand" is called "mouth", "mouth" is called "ear", "ear" is called "nose", and "nose" is called "tongue", with which of the following would a person hear?

**Solution:**
We hear with "ear", but "ear" is called "nose".
**Answer:** Nose 👃[^1]

---

#### **Q6.**

If "MONITOR" = 49 and "NARCOTIC" = 64, how is "STUPENDOUS" coded?

**Solution:**
MONITOR has 7 letters, 7²=49.
NARCOTIC has 8 letters, 8²=64.
STUPENDOUS has 10 letters, 10²=**100**[^1]
**Answer:** 100 💯

---

#### **Q7.**

If "EASY" is written as "5117", how is "BEAM" written?

**Solution:**
E=5, A=1, S=19 (1+9=10, 1+0=1), Y=25 (2+5=7).
So, EASY=5117.
BEAM: B=2, E=5, A=1, M=13 (1+3=4).
**Answer:** 2514[^1]
**Answer:** 2514 📝

---

#### **Q8.**

If "SPECIAL" is 65, what is "CONNECT"?

**Solution:**
Sum of place values: C=3, O=15, N=14, N=14, E=5, C=3, T=20
Total: 3+15+14+14+5+3+20=**74**[^1]
**Answer:** 74 🔗

### **Chinese Coding Example** 🈳

Given:

- ‘si ta mi’ = ‘Seeta is dancing’
- ‘ge ma ta ki’ = ‘jewellery shop is there’
- ‘si la za’ = ‘Seeta likes sweet’
- ‘za ta ki’ = ‘sweet is there’

**Q:** Which word means "jewellery"?
**Solution:**
‘ge’ or ‘ma’ (since both only appear with "jewellery")[^1]
**Answer:** ge or ma 💍

---

### **Binary (Clock) Coding Example** ⏰

A=0, B=1, BA=2, BB=3, BAA=4, BAB=5, ...
**Q:** What is the average of BBBB and BBBBB?

- BBBB = 1111 (binary) = 15
- BBBBB = 11111 (binary) = 31
Average = (15+31)/2 = **23**[^1]
**Answer:** 23 🕒

---

### **Quick Tips \& Memory Aids** 💡

- Use "EJOTY" for quick reference to alphabet positions.
- Always check for opposite letters or position-based patterns.
- For substitution, follow the chain until you reach the answer.
- For number codes, check if it's a sum, square, or manipulation of letter positions.
- For Chinese coding, match common words across statements.
