## Introduction to Coding-Decoding

**Coding** is the process of encrypting a word or message using a specific pattern or rule, while **decoding** is the reverse process of converting the code back to its original form. These types of questions are common in competitive exams and test your logical reasoning and pattern recognition skills.

## Types of Coding-Decoding

### 1. **Letter to Letter Coding**

**Description:**
Each letter of a word is replaced by another letter using a specific rule such as shifting forward/backward in the alphabet, interchanging letters, or other operations.

**Example from PDF:**
If "ENGLISH" is coded as "FOHNHRG", and you need to code "SCIENCE", you observe the pattern: each letter is shifted forward or backward by a certain number, or other rules are applied.
In another example, "FRIEND" is coded as "UIRVMW" by taking the opposite letter in the alphabet (A ↔ Z, B ↔ Y, etc.), so "TRADER" becomes "GIZWVI"[^1].

**Practice Question:**
If "TIGER" is coded as "SHFQS" (each letter is shifted one position back), code "LION" using the same logic.
**Answer:** KHNM

### 2. **Letter to Number Coding**

**Description:**
Letters are assigned numerical codes based on their position in the alphabet. Sometimes, numbers are manipulated (added, subtracted, multiplied, or digits summed).

**Example from PDF:**

- "GIVE" is coded as "810236" and "BOND" as "316155". The pattern may involve assigning unique numbers to each letter or manipulating their positions.
- If Y = 50, SEA = 50, then YACHT is calculated as (sum of letter positions) × 2: (25+1+3+8+20) × 2 = 57 × 2 = 114[^1].

**Practice Question:**
If "CAT" is coded as "3120" (C=3, A=1, T=20), code "DOG".
**Answer:** 4157

---

### 3. **Substitutional Coding**

**Description:**
Words are coded by substituting them with other words.

**Example from PDF:**
If 'eye' is called 'hand', 'hand' is called 'mouth', and so on, and you are asked with which word a person would hear, you follow the substitution chain:
A person hears from the 'ear', but 'ear' is called 'nose', so the answer is 'nose'[^1].

**Practice Question:**
If 'apple' is called 'orange', 'orange' is called 'banana', and 'banana' is called 'mango', what is the real name of 'orange'?
**Answer:** Banana

---

### 4. **Chinese Coding**

**Description:**
Statements with common words are coded, and you need to decode the meaning of words based on their repetition in different sentences.

**Example from PDF:**

- 'si ta mi' means 'Seeta is dancing'
- 'ge ma ta ki' means 'jewellery shop is there'
- 'si la za' means 'Seeta likes sweet'
- 'za ta ki' means 'sweet is there'

By comparing, you find:
'si' = 'Seeta', 'ta' = 'is', 'ki' = 'there', 'za' = 'sweet', etc.
Hence, 'jewellery' is coded as either 'ge' or 'ma'[^1].

**Practice Question:**
If 'mo pa la' means 'dog is brown', 'pa ni mo' means 'brown is animal', and 'la ni si' means 'animal is pet', what is the code for 'dog'?
**Answer:** mo

### 5. **LSN (Letter, Symbol, Number) Coding**

**Description:**
Words are coded using a combination of letters, symbols, and numbers based on specific rules.

**Example from PDF:**
"The rank wombat waves" → "%e3 \$k4 @t6 @s5".
Rule:

- First character: symbol based on the first letter
- Second character: last letter of the word
- Third character: number of letters in the word
So, "sleeps" is coded as "(s6"[^1].

**Practice Question:**
If "apple" is coded as "\#e5", code "banana".
**Answer:** \#a6

---

### 6. **Conditional Coding**

**Description:**
Codes are assigned based on conditions related to the first and last letters of words (e.g., vowels/consonants).

**Example from PDF:**

- If the first letter is a vowel and the last is a consonant, their codes are interchanged.
- If both are consonants, both are coded as 'β'.
- If the first is a consonant and the last is a vowel, both are coded as the code for the vowel.

Given a code table, "IBHWPO" is coded as "361954" because none of the conditions apply[^1].

**Practice Question:**
Using the same table and conditions, code "APPLE" if A = \$, P = 5, L = @, E = 8.
**Answer:** \$58@8 (assuming no condition applies, but check if first and last letters are vowels/consonants and apply the rule accordingly.)

---

### 7. **Clock Coding**

**Description:**
Numbers or symbols represent hours and minutes on a clock.

**Example from PDF:**
A = 2, B = 3, % = 4, @ = 6, \& = 7, \# = 9.
A B = 2:15, %@ = 4:30.
If you need to leave at a certain time and travel for a duration, you can calculate the departure time using clock coding[^1].

**Practice Question:**
If \& = 7, \# = 9, and \&@ means 7:30, what does %A mean if % = 4, A = 2?
**Answer:** 4:10 (if A is interpreted as 2:10, but clarify the exact coding rule for minutes.)

---

### 8. **Binary (0/1) Clock Coding**

**Description:**
A and B represent 0 and 1, and numbers are coded in binary.

**Example from PDF:**
A = 0, B = 1.
BA = 10 (binary) = 2 (decimal), BB = 11 = 3, BAA = 100 = 4, etc.
Average of BBBB (15) and BBBBB (31) = 23[^1].

**Practice Question:**
If A = 0, B = 1, what is the decimal value of BAAB?
**Answer:** 1001 (binary) = 9

## Practice Questions (with Explanations)

1. **Letter Coding:**
If "DELHI" is written as "EDMGJ", code "NEPAL".
**Explanation:** Each letter is shifted alternately (first +1, next -1, etc.).
**Answer:** ODOZM (if pattern is +1, -1, +1, -1, +1).
2. **Number Coding:**
If "PIPE" is written as "169165", code "SWAN".
**Explanation:** Each letter's position is written as two digits (P=16, I=09, P=16, E=05).
**Answer:** 1923114 (S=19, W=23, A=01, N=14; but check if leading zero is needed. If yes: 19230114, but standard is 1923114 if A is 1 and single digit is not padded.)
3. **Mixed Coding:**
If 'blue' means 'car', 'car' means 'wood', 'wood' means 'rice', 'rice' means 'chair', what do we eat?
**Explanation:** We eat rice, but 'rice' means 'chair'.
**Answer:** Chair[^1].
4. **Word Arrangement Coding:**
If 'LEMON' is written as 'ELMNO', code 'CLUSTER'.
**Explanation:** Letters are arranged in alphabetical order.
**Answer:** CELRSTU[^2].
5. **Sum of Letters Coding:**
If "SEND" is coded as 168, and logic is (sum of letters) × (number of letters), code "PURSE".
**Explanation:** P+U+R+S+E = 16+21+18+19+5 = 79 × 5 = 395.
**Answer:** 395[^2].
