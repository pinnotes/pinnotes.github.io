## Detailed Explanation of Inequality Reasoning

**Inequality Reasoning** involves comparing two or more elements using symbols such as $>$, $<$, $=$, $\geq$, $\leq$, and $\neq$. The goal is to deduce definite relationships between elements based on the given statements and to evaluate the validity of the conclusions drawn from them.

### **Key Concepts and Symbols**

| Symbol | Meaning |
| :-- | :-- |
| $A > B$ | A is greater than B |
| $A < B$ | A is smaller than B |
| $A = B$ | A is equal to B |
| $A \geq B$ | A is greater than or equal to B |
| $A \leq B$ | A is less than or equal to B |
| $A \neq B$ | A is not equal to B |
| $A \not \leq B$ | A is greater than B |
| $A \not < B$ | A is greater than or equal to B |

### **How to Solve Inequality Questions**

1. **Combine Statements:** Write all inequalities in a single chain if possible.
2. **Analyze Relationships:** Check if a direct relationship can be established between the elements in the conclusions.
3. **Evaluate Conclusions:** For each conclusion, see if it logically follows from the combined statements.
4. **Special Cases:**
    - **Either-Or Case:** If two conclusions form a complementary pair (e.g., $A > B$ and $A \leq B$), and both are individually false, then "either-or" is true.
    - **No Direct Relationship:** If you cannot establish a definite relationship, the conclusion is invalid.

## **Solved Examples**

### **Example 1: Direct Inequality**

**Statement:**
$H < A < T = G > U \geq V \geq B$

**Conclusions:**
I. $T > B$
II. $G > H$

**Solution:**

- **Combine:** $H < A < T = G > U \geq V \geq B$
- **Conclusion I:** $T > B$ is true because $T = G > U \geq V \geq B$
- **Conclusion II:** $G > H$ is true because $H < A < T = G$
- **Answer:** Both conclusions I and II follow.

---

### **Example 2: No Direct Relationship**

**Statement:**
$F > Y \geq X < Z$, $C \leq X < W$

**Conclusions:**
I. $Z > C$
II. $F > W$

**Solution:**

- **Combine:** $F > Y \geq X \geq C$ and $F > Y \geq X < W$
- **Conclusion I:** $Z > C$ is true because $X \geq C$ and $X < Z$, so $Z > X \geq C$
- **Conclusion II:** $F > W$ is false because $F > Y \geq X < W$ does not establish a relationship between $F$ and $W$
- **Answer:** Only conclusion I follows.

---

### **Example 3: Either-Or Case**

**Statement:**
$B = K \geq H = T > U \leq I$

**Conclusions:**
I. $H > I$
II. $H \leq I$

**Solution:**

- **Combine:** $B = K \geq H = T > U \leq I$
- **Conclusion I:** $H > I$ is false because $H = T > U \leq I$ does not mean $H > I$
- **Conclusion II:** $H \leq I$ is false because $H = T > U \leq I$ does not mean $H \leq I$
- **But:** Both conclusions are complementary and both are false individually, so "either-or" is true.
- **Answer:** Either conclusion I or II follows.

---

### **Example 4: Coded Inequality**

**Symbols:**

- $A @ B$: $A \leq B$
- $A \# B$: $A \geq B$
- $$
A \$ B$: $A = B
$$
- $A \% B$: $A < B$
- $A * B$: $A > B$

**Statements:**

$$
R \$ J; J \% Y; C @ Y
$$

**Conclusions:**
I. $C \% J$
II. $R * Y$
III. $R * C$

**Solution:**

- **Decode:** $R = J; J < Y; C \leq Y$
- **Combine:** $R = J < Y \geq C$
- **Conclusion I:** $C < J$ is false (no direct relation)
- **Conclusion II:** $R > Y$ is false ($R = J < Y$
- **Conclusion III:** $R > C$ is false (no direct relation)
- **Answer:** None follows.

II. $A \geq Y$
III. $Q \geq Z$
IV. $Q \geq X$

**Solution:**

- **Combine:** $X = Y > Z \leq A = Q > R \geq S < W$
- **I:** $W > R$ is false (no direct relation)
- **II:** $A \geq Y$ is false (no direct relation)
- **III:** $Q \geq Z$ is true
- **IV:** $Q \geq X$ is false (no direct relation)
- **Answer:** Only III is true.

## **Tips for Solving Inequality Questions**

- **Always combine all statements if possible.**
- **Look for direct relationships between elements in the conclusions.**
- **Be cautious about "either-or" cases where both conclusions are individually false but together cover all possibilities.**
- **Practice with both direct and coded inequalities.**

## **Summary Table**

| Question Type | Key Point | Example Answer |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Direct Inequality | Combine and check direct relationships | Both I and II follow |
| No Direct Relation | "Can't say" if no direct relation | Only I follows |
| Either-Or Case | Both conclusions are complementary | Either I or II follows |
| Coded Inequality | Decode symbols, then proceed as above | None follows |
