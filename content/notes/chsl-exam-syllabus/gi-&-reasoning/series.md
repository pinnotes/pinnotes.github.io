## Introduction to Series (Alpha/Numeric/Figural)

**Series reasoning** involves identifying patterns or rules in sequences of letters, numbers, symbols, or figures and using these patterns to answer questions about missing elements, positions, or relationships.

---

## Types of Series in Reasoning

### 1. **Alphabet Series**

- **Definition:** Arranging letters or groups of letters in a sequence or pattern.
- **Key Concepts:**
    - **Vowels:** A, E, I, O, U
    - **Consonants:** All other letters
    - **Dictionary Order:** Arranging words in alphabetical order
    - **Interchanging Letters:** Swapping first and last letters, etc.
- **Example:**
    - **Given:** DEW, BIG, RAW, FAN, DOG
    - **Interchange first and last letters:** WED, GIB, WAR, NAF, GOD
    - **Arrange in dictionary order:** GIB, GOD, NAF, WAR, WED
    - **Last word:** WED

**Practice Question:**
If you swap the first and last letters of each word in the following list, how many meaningful words are formed?
**List:** CAT, RAT, BAT, TAP
**Answer:** CAT → TAC (not meaningful), RAT → TAR (meaningful), BAT → TAB (meaningful), TAP → PAT (meaningful)
**Total = 3**

### 2. **Number Series**

- **Definition:** Sequences of numbers following a specific rule (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, digit manipulation).
- **Key Concepts:**
    - **Prime Numbers:** 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ...
    - **Even/Odd Numbers:** 0, 2, 4, 6, ... / 1, 3, 5, 7, ...
    - **Digit Operations:** Adding to digits, swapping digits, etc.
- **Example:**
    - **Given:** 567, 289, 376, 189, 852
    - **Add 1 to the second digit of each number:** 577, 299, 386, 199, 862
    - **Interchange first and last digits:** 775, 992, 683, 991, 268
    - **Highest number:** 992

**Practice Question:**
If you arrange the digits of each number in increasing order, which number from the series 234, 541, 321, 654, 123 will be the lowest?
**Answer:**
123 → 123
234 → 234
321 → 123 (but 123 is already present, so the correct unique lowest after rearrangement is 123 from 321 or 123 itself)
**But if you mean after arranging digits:**
234 → 234
541 → 145
321 → 123
654 → 456
123 → 123
**Lowest:** 123 (from 321 or 123), but if only unique numbers after rearrangement, 145 (from 541) is not the lowest, so clarify the question.
**If you mean after rearranging digits, the lowest number formed is 123 (from both 123 and 321).**

### 3. **Mixed Series**

- **Definition:** Sequences containing a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.
- **Key Concepts:**
    - **Position-based questions:** Find the nth element from the left/right, or relative positions.
    - **Operation-based series:** Apply rules like swapping vowels, replacing symbols, etc.
- **Example:**
    - **Given:** A B 6 P 7 2 Z @ X ? V T W \# \& N S L %
    - **Which element is 6th to the left of the 12th element from the left?**
        - **12th from left:** X
        - **6th to the left of X:** 2 (count back 6 positions from X)
    - **Which element is 4th to the right of the 11th element from the left?**
        - **11th from left:** ?
        - **4th to the right of ?:** \& (count forward 4 positions from ?)

**Practice Question:**
In the series: 6 R 0 T 4 A 8 % B F 1 E \# W @ 9 H I \$ M N * 3 2 V \$ 5 G P 7 Q
**How many consonants are immediately preceded by a consonant and immediately followed by a number?**
**Answer:**
Look for the pattern: consonant-consonant-number
**B F 1** and **G P 7**
**Total = 2**

---

### 4. **Operation-based Series**

- **Definition:** Apply specific operations step-by-step to the series.
- **Example:**
    - **Step 1:** Exchange vowels with their next letter (A→B, E→F, etc.)
    - **Step 2:** Replace symbols with 8
    - **Step 3:** Increase numbers by 1
    - **Input:** NPLB S% \&1E4G4\$TG2I0UK@17VA
    - **After Step 1:** NPLB S% \&1F4G4\$TG2J0VK@17VB
    - **After Step 2:** NPLB S88 1F4G48TG2J0VK817VB
    - **After Step 3:** NPLB S88 2F5G59TG3J1VK928VB

**Practice Question:**
If all symbols are removed from the series 6 R 0 T 4 A 8 % B F 1 E \# W @ 9 H I \$ M N * 3 2 V \$ 5 G P 7 Q, which element is 5th to the right of the 10th from the right end?
**Answer:**

- **Remove symbols:** 6 R 0 T 4 A 8 B F 1 E W 9 H I M N 3 2 V 5 G P 7 Q
- **10th from right:** 2
- **5th to the right of 2:** 5

### 5. **Figural Series**

- **Definition:** Sequences of figures where each figure changes in a specific way (rotation, shading, adding elements, etc.).
- **Key Concepts:**
    - **Clockwise/Anticlockwise Rotation:** Figures rotate by 45°, 90°, 135°, etc.
    - **Shading/Unshading:** Parts of the figure change shading in each step.
    - **Adding/Removing Elements:** New elements are added or removed in each step.
- **Example:**
    - **Problem:** A series of figures where a pin is inverted in each step.
    - **Answer:** The figure with the next pin inverted continues the series.

**Practice Question:**
If a series of squares shows a shaded region moving one step clockwise in each figure, which figure comes next?
**Answer:** The figure with the shaded region in the next clockwise position.

## Solved Examples and Practice Questions

### **Alphabet Series Practice**

**Q1:** Arrange the following words in dictionary order after swapping the first and last letters:
**Words:** CAT, DOG, RAT, BAT
**Answer:**
CAT → TAC
DOG → GOD
RAT → TAR
BAT → TAB
**Dictionary order:** GOD, TAB, TAC, TAR
**First word:** GOD

---

### **Number Series Practice**

**Q2:** Find the missing number: 2, 7, 14, 23, ?, 47
**Solution:**
Differences: 5, 7, 9, 11, 13
**Missing number:** 23 + 11 = 34[^2]

**Q3:** Find the next number: 4, 6, 9, 13.5, ?
**Solution:**
Multiply by 1.5 each time
**Next number:** 13.5 × 1.5 = 20.25[^2]

---

### **Mixed Series Practice**

**Q4:** In the series: 6 R 0 T 4 A 8 % B F 1 E \# W @ 9 H I \$ M N * 3 2 V \$ 5 G P 7 Q
**How many vowels are immediately preceded by a letter but not immediately followed by a symbol?**
**Answer:**
Look for: letter-vowel-letter/number
**R 0 T** (O is not a vowel in English, but if A is considered, check for A, E, I, etc.)
Assuming A is a vowel:
A is preceded by 4 (number), not a letter.
E is preceded by 1 (number), not a letter.
I is preceded by H (letter), followed by \$ (symbol, so not counted if the question says "not followed by symbol").
**If the question is about vowels immediately preceded by a letter and not followed by a symbol:**
Only possible if a vowel is after a letter and before a letter/number.
In the given series, no such case exists for standard vowels A, E, I.
**Clarification needed for the exact question, but based on the PDF example, the answer is 1 (R-O-T, but O is not a vowel in English; likely a typo or misprint).**

---

### **Figural Series Practice**

**Q5:** In a series of figures, a square rotates 90° clockwise in each step. If the first figure is a square with a dot at the top, what will the next figure look like?
**Answer:**
Square with the dot on the right side.

## Additional Tips

- **Identify the pattern or rule in the series.**
- **For number series, check for arithmetic, geometric, or digit-based patterns.**
- **For alphabet series, consider dictionary order, letter positions, or word operations.**
- **For mixed series, pay attention to the type and position of each element.**
- **For figural series, note the direction and type of change in each step.**
