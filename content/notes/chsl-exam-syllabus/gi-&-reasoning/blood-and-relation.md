## Types of Blood Relation Questions

**1. Pointing or Introducing** 👉
Someone introduces or points at another person, and you have to find the relation.

**Example:**
Q: Pointing to a lady, Rahul said, “She is the wife of my mother’s father’s only grandchild.”
A:

- Rahul’s mother’s father = Rahul’s grandfather
- Grandfather’s only grandchild = Rahul
- The lady is the wife of Rahul
**Answer:** The lady is Rahul’s wife 👩‍❤️‍👨[^1].

---

**2. Family Tree** 🌳
Given relationships, you draw a family tree and answer questions about connections.

**Example:**
Rahul is the son of Mohan. Hari is the father of Manu. Rahul is married to Dina. Rahul and Manu are siblings. Kanav is the brother of Dina. Mohan has only one son. Neha is the son of Rahul. Kanav is the father of Akash.

Q: What is the relation between Kanav and Akash?
A: Kanav is the father of Akash. Akash’s gender is not given, so Akash could be a son or daughter.
**Answer:** Cannot be determined (son or daughter) 🤷[^1].

---

**3. Coded Relations** 🔢
Relations are shown with symbols or codes.

**Example:**
Symbols:

- \$ = Sister
- % = Brother
- \& = Mother
- @ = Son

Q: How is F related to D in the expression D % C @ G \$ H \$ F?
A:

- D % C → D is brother of C
- C @ G → C is son of G
- G \$ H → G is sister of H
- H \$ F → H is sister of F
Since F’s gender is unknown, F could be uncle or aunt of D.
**Answer:** Uncle or Aunt 👨‍🦱👩‍🦱[^1].

## Tricks \& Tips 🧠

- Always consider “ME” as the person introducing in the question.
- Don’t assume gender from names (e.g., Sonu can be male or female).
- “Only son/daughter” doesn’t mean “only child.”
- In coded questions, eliminate options where gender is unknown or incorrect.

**Q2.** In a family, A is the mother of B. C is the father of A. D is the brother of B. How is D related to C?
**Solution:**

- A is B’s mother
- C is A’s father → C is B’s grandfather
- D is B’s brother → D is also A’s son, so D is C’s grandson

**Q3.** If P % Q means P is the brother of Q, P \$ Q means P is the sister of Q, and P \& Q means P is the mother of Q, then what does R \& S % T mean?
**Solution:**

- S % T → S is brother of T
- R \& S → R is mother of S
- So, R is mother of S and S is brother of T → R is mother of both S and T
**Answer:** R is the mother of S and T 👩‍👧‍👦

---

**Q4.** Which of the following expressions shows I as the brother of H?
Options:

1) H\#P\$I
2) H%P\$I

4) H%I\$P

**Solution:**

- % = Sister (female), \$ = Father (male), \# = Son (male)
- Only option 4 (H%I\$P) fits: I is the brother (since \$ = father, so I is male)
**Answer:** Option 4 (H%I\$P) ✔️
