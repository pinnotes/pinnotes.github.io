## Figural Pattern (Folding and Completion): Detailed Explanation

**Figural pattern (folding and completion)** questions are a staple in reasoning sections of competitive exams. These questions test your spatial reasoning, visualization skills, and ability to mentally manipulate two-dimensional figures.

---

### **Types of Figural Pattern Questions**

- **Paper Folding:**
    - A transparent sheet (often a square or triangle) is folded along dotted lines.
    - You must select from answer options how the pattern would appear after folding.
- **Paper Cutting:**
    - A piece of paper is folded and then cut/punched.
    - You must determine how the paper would look when unfolded.
- **Completion of Figure:**
    - A figure is partially shown, and you must select the missing part from given options to complete the pattern.

### **Key Concepts and Techniques**

- **Folding Along Dotted Lines:**
    - The dotted line indicates where the paper is folded.
    - The arrow shows the direction of the fold.
- **Cutting/Punching:**
    - After folding, cuts or punches are made.
    - These cuts appear symmetrically on all folded layers when unfolded.
- **Visualizing Unfolding:**
    - To solve, mentally reverse the folding and cutting steps.
    - Start from the last folded/cut figure and work backward to the original.
- **Orientation Matters:**
    - The final unfolded pattern must match the orientation and symmetry of the answer options.
- **No Fixed Formula:**
    - There’s no set formula; practice and visualization are key.

### **Step-by-Step Examples**

#### **Example 1: Paper Folding**

> **A square transparent sheet with a pattern is given. Figure out from among the four alternatives as to how the pattern would appear when the transparent sheet is folded at the middle line shown.**
>
> **Options:**
> (a) Pattern is incorrect
> (b) Pattern is incorrect
> (c) Pattern is incorrect
> (d) Pattern is correct
>
> **Explanation:**
> - **Step 1:** Fold the sheet at the middle line.
> - **Step 2:** The pattern on the right half is mirrored onto the left half.
> - **Step 3:** Only option (d) shows the correct mirrored pattern.
>
> **Answer:** (d)

#### **Example 2: Paper Cutting and Unfolding**

> **A piece of paper is folded and punched as shown in the question figures. From the given answer figures, indicate how it will appear when opened.**
>
> **Options:**
> (a) Pattern is incorrect
> (b) Pattern is incorrect
> (c) Pattern is incorrect
> (d) Pattern is correct
>
> **Explanation:**
> - **Step 1:** Start with the last folded/cut figure.
> - **Step 2:** Mentally unfold the paper step by step.
> - **Step 3:** Observe the symmetry and position of the cuts.
> - **Step 4:** Only option (d) matches the correct unfolded pattern.
>
> **Answer:** (d)

---

#### **Example 3: Completion of Figure**

> **A figure is partially shown. Select the missing part from the given options to complete the pattern.**
>
> **Options:**
> (a) Incorrect
> (b) Correct
> (c) Incorrect
> (d) Incorrect
>
> **Explanation:**
> - **Step 1:** Observe the pattern and symmetry.
> - **Step 2:** Identify the missing part that fits the pattern.
> - **Step 3:** Only option (b) completes the figure correctly.
>
> **Answer:** (b)

>
> **Options:**
> (a)
> (b)
> (c)
> (d)
>
> **Answer:** (a)

---

#### **Practice Question 4**

> **A square transparent sheet with a pattern is given. How would the pattern appear when folded along the dotted line?**
>
> **Options:**
> (a)
> (b)
> (c)
> (d)
>
> **Hint:** Look for symmetry and mirroring across the fold.
>
> **Answer:** (c)

### **Tips for Solving Figural Pattern Questions**

- **Draw or visualize each step if possible.**
- **Reverse-engineer the process: start from the last folded/cut figure and unfold.**
- **Check for symmetry and orientation in the answer options.**
- **Don’t get stuck on complex figures; rotate or flip mentally if needed.**
- **Time yourself; aim to solve within 60 seconds per question.**

| Paper Folding | Fold along dotted line, select mirrored pattern | (d) |
| Paper Cutting | Fold, cut, unfold, select correct pattern | (d), (a) |
| Completion of Figure | Select missing part to complete the pattern | (b) |
