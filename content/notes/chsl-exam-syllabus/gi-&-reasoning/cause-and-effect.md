## Cause and Effect: Detailed Explanation

**Definition and Purpose**

Cause and effect reasoning involves identifying the relationship between two statements or events. In competitive exams, each question presents two statements, and your task is to determine if one is the cause of the other, if both are effects of a common cause, or if they are independent[^1][^5][^6].

**Key Concepts**

- **Cause:** The reason or event that makes something happen.
- **Effect:** The result or consequence of the cause.
- **Independent Causes:** Two events that are not related to each other.
- **Common Cause:** Both statements are effects of the same underlying reason.
- **Chronological Order:** The cause always occurs before the effect[^6].

**Types of Relationships**

1. **Direct Cause and Effect:** One statement is the cause, and the other is its direct effect.
2. **Common Cause:** Both statements are effects of a common underlying reason.
3. **Independent Causes/Effects:** The two statements are unrelated or are effects of independent causes.
4. **Reverse Cause and Effect:** Sometimes, the order may seem reversed, but the logical sequence must be maintained[^1][^5].
