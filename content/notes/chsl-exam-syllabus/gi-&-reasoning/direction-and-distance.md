## Detailed Explanation of Direction and Distance

**Direction and Distance** problems test your ability to accurately interpret movement instructions and determine final positions or directions relative to a starting point. These questions are common in competitive exams and require a clear understanding of cardinal directions, right/left turns, and how to calculate shortest distances[^1][^2][^5].

---

### **1. Main and Subordinate Directions**

- **Main Directions:** North (N), South (S), East (E), West (W).
- **Subordinate (Cardinal) Directions:**
    - North-East (NE): Between North and East
    - South-East (SE): Between South and East
    - South-West (SW): Between South and West
    - North-West (NW): Between North and West[^1][^2]

---

### **2. Types of Direction and Distance Questions**

- **Direction-Based:** Determine the final direction after a series of movements.
- **Distance-Based:** Calculate the total or shortest distance from the starting point.
- **Degree-Based:** Use clockwise or anticlockwise turns measured in degrees (not always used).
- **Shadow-Based:** Use the position of the sun and shadows to infer direction[^1][^2].

---

### **3. Solving Steps**

1. **Draw a Diagram:** Represent the starting point and plot each movement.
2. **Follow Instructions:** Move as per the given directions and distances.
3. **Track Turns:** Remember, a "right" or "left" turn is relative to your current facing direction.
4. **Calculate Shortest Distance:** Use the Pythagorean theorem for right-angled triangles:

$$
\text{Shortest Distance} = \sqrt{(\text{Base})^2 + (\text{Height})^2}
$$
5. **Shadow Interpretation:**
    - **Morning:** Sun is in the East; shadow falls to the West.
    - **Evening:** Sun is in the West; shadow falls to the East[^1][^2].

## **Examples from the PDF**

### **Example 1: Direction after Movement**

> **Leeta walks 2 km north, turns right, walks 2 km, turns right again, walks 2 km. Which direction is she facing now?**

- **Step 1:** Start at origin, face North.
- **Step 2:** Walk 2 km north.
- **Step 3:** Turn right (now facing East), walk 2 km.
- **Step 4:** Turn right (now facing South), walk 2 km.
- **Final Direction:** South[^1].
> **Answer:** (3) South

---

### **Example 2: Distance from Start**

> **Amitabh walks 15 km south, turns right, walks 10 km, turns right, walks 15 km. How far is he from the start?**

- **Step 1:** Start at origin, face South.
- **Step 2:** Walk 15 km south.
- **Step 3:** Turn right (now facing West), walk 10 km.
- **Step 4:** Turn right (now facing North), walk 15 km.
- **Final Position:** 10 km west of the starting point.
> **Answer:** (3) 10 km[^1].

---

### **Example 3: Shadow-Based Direction**

> **In the morning, Mohan and Gaurav stand back to back. Mohan's shadow falls on his left. Which direction does Gaurav face?**

- **Morning:** Sun in East, shadow to West.
- **Shadow on Mohan's left:** Mohan is facing North.
- **Gaurav is back to Mohan:** Gaurav faces South[^1].
> **Answer:** (1) South

## **Practice Questions**

### **Question 1**

> **Prakash travels 6 km north, turns left, walks 4 km, turns left, walks 6 km. How far is he from his starting point?**

- **Solution:**
    - 6 km north, left (West), 4 km, left (South), 6 km.
    - Final position: 4 km west of start.
> **Answer:** (2) 4 km[^1].

---

### **Question 2**

> **Ramesh walks 2 km north, turns right, walks 4 km, turns right, walks 4 km, turns right, walks 4 km. In which direction is he facing now?**

- **Solution:**
    - North, right (East), right (South), right (West).
> **Answer:** (4) West[^1].

---

### **Question 3**

> **Robin walks 2 km east, then northwest 3 km, then south 5 km, then west 2 km, then north 6 km. In which direction is he from the starting point?**

- **Solution:**
    - Plot each move. Final position is northwest of start.
> **Answer:** (3) North-west[^1].

---

### **Question 4**

> **Vicky walks 2 km south, turns right, walks 3 km, turns left, walks 4 km, turns left, walks 3 km. In which direction is he from his starting point?**

- **Solution:**
    - Final position is south of start.
> **Answer:** (4) South[^1].

---

### **Question 5**

> **If south-east becomes north, north-east becomes west, and so on, what does east become?**

- **Solution:**
    - Rotate the compass 135° clockwise. East becomes North-West.
> **Answer:** (4) North-West[^1].

---

## **Additional Practice Questions**

### **Question 6**

> **Nitara walks 1 km west, turns left, walks 1 km, turns left, walks 1 km, turns left, walks 450 m. How far is she from her starting point?**

- **Solution:**
    - 1 km west, left (South), 1 km, left (East), 1 km, left (North), 450 m.
    - Net distance from start: 1 km - 450 m = 550 m west.
> **Answer:** 550 m[^3].

---

### **Question 7**

> **Mr. X drives 9 km west, left turn (South), 5 km, right (West), 4 km, right (North), 7 km, right (East), 13 km. How far and in which direction should he drive to return to point A?**

- **Solution:**
    - Final position: 2 km south of start.
    - To return: Drive 2 km north.
> **Answer:** 2 km north[^3].

---

### **Question 8**

> **Isack drives 6 km south, right (West), 3 km, right (North), 9 km, right (East), 5 km, right (South), 3 km. How far and in which direction should he drive to return to point A?**

- **Solution:**
    - Final position: 2 km west of start.
    - To return: Drive 2 km east.
> **Answer:** 2 km east[^3].

## **Summary Table**

| Question Type | Example/Key Point |
| :-- | :-- |
| Direction after move | Leeta faces South after turns |
| Distance from start | Amitabh is 10 km west of start |
| Shadow-based | Gaurav faces South if shadow on left |
