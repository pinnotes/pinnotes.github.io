    - Facing North: Right ➡️ East, Left ⬅️ West
    - Facing South: Right ➡️ West, Left ⬅️ East
- **Shortest Distance:**
    - Use Pythagoras Theorem:

$$
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(\text{East-West})^2 + (\text{North-South})^2}
$$
- **Shadow Rules:**
    - **Morning:** Shadow falls to the West
    - **Evening:** Shadow falls to the East
