## 📅 Calendar Study Material for SSC CHSL Reasoning (With Emojis \& Practice Questions)


### **What is a Calendar?** 🗓️

A calendar is a chart that shows days, weeks, and months of a year. It helps us keep track of dates and plan events. In reasoning exams, calendar questions check your ability to calculate days, weeks, and leap years easily[^1].

---

### **Basic Structure of a Calendar** 🏗️

- **Ordinary Year**: 365 days (e.g., 2019, 2021) ➡️ **1 odd day**
- **Leap Year**: 366 days (e.g., 2020, 2024) ➡️ **2 odd days**
    - Leap year: Divisible by 4 (except century years, which must be divisible by 400)

---

### **Odd Days Concept** 🤔

- **Odd days**: Extra days after complete weeks in a period.
- **31-day months**: 3 odd days (Jan, Mar, May, Jul, Aug, Oct, Dec)
- **30-day months**: 2 odd days (Apr, Jun, Sep, Nov)
- **February**: 0 odd days (ordinary), 1 odd day (leap)

| Month | Odd Days (Ordinary/Leap) |
| :-- | :-- |
| January | 3 |
| February | 0 / 1 |
| March | 3 |
| April | 2 |
| May | 3 |
| June | 2 |
| July | 3 |
| August | 3 |
| September | 2 |
| October | 3 |
| November | 2 |
| December | 3 |


---

### **Day Coding for Quick Calculation** 🔢

| Day | Code |
| :-- | :-- |
| Sunday | 0 |
| Monday | 1 |
| Tuesday | 2 |
| Wednesday | 3 |
| Thursday | 4 |
| Friday | 5 |
| Saturday | 6 |


---

### **Leap Year Rules** 🏆

- Year divisible by 4 = Leap year (e.g., 2016, 2020)
- Century year (ending with 00): Must be divisible by 400 to be a leap year (e.g., 2000 is leap, 1900 is not)[^1]

---

### **Odd Days in Centuries** 📈

| Century | Odd Days | Day of Week Ends On |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 100 | 5 | Friday |
| 200 | 3 | Wednesday |
| 300 | 1 | Monday |
| 400 | 0 | Sunday |

- The cycle repeats every 400 years!

## 📝 Practice Questions with Detailed Solutions


---

### **Q1. What day of the week was 15th August 1947? 🇮🇳**

**Solution:**

1. Break into periods:
    - 1600 years (0 odd days)
    - 300 years (1 odd day)
    - 46 years (from 1901 to 1946): 11 leap years, 35 ordinary years
        - 11 × 2 + 35 × 1 = 22 + 35 = 57 odd days → 57 ÷ 7 = 1 odd day
    - 1st Jan to 15th Aug 1947: 3 odd days
2. Total odd days = 0 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 5
3. 5 = Friday

**Answer:** **Friday** 🎉[^1]

---

### **Q2. Today is Monday. What day will it be after 61 days?**

**Solution:**

- 61 ÷ 7 = 8 weeks + 5 days
- Monday + 5 = Saturday

**Answer:** **Saturday** 🛍️[^1]

---

### **Q3. Is 1900 a leap year?**

**Solution:**

- 1900 is divisible by 4, but as a century year, it must be divisible by 400.
- 1900 ÷ 400 = 4.75 (not a whole number)
- So, **not a leap year**.

**Answer:** **No, 1900 is not a leap year.** 🚫[^1]

---

### **Q4. Find the day of the week on 27th Dec 1985.**

**Solution:**

- 1984 years: 1600 (0 odd) + 300 (1 odd) + 84 (0 odd)
- 11 months + 27 days: 361 days = 51 weeks + 4 odd days
- Total odd days = 1 + 4 = 5 → Friday

**Answer:** **Friday** 🥳[^1]

---

### **Q5. Today is Wednesday. What will be the day after 91 days?**

**Solution:**

- 91 ÷ 7 = 13 weeks (no extra days)
- The day repeats: **Wednesday**.

**Answer:** **Wednesday** 🔄[^1]

---

### **Q6. Which year after 2009 will have the same calendar as 2009?**

**Solution:**

- Sum odd days year-wise until total is a multiple of 7:
    - 2009 (1), 2010 (1), 2011 (1), 2012 (2), 2013 (1), 2014 (1) = 7 odd days
- 2009 + 6 = **2015**

**Answer:** **2015** 🗓️[^1]

---

### **Q7. Today is Friday. What day will it be after 59 days?**

**Solution:**

- 59 ÷ 7 = 8 weeks + 3 days

- Saturday + 2 = **Monday**

**Answer:** **Monday** 🏫[^1]

---

### **Q10. Today is Monday. What will be the day after 32 days?**

**Solution:**

- 32 ÷ 7 = 4 weeks + 4 days
- Monday + 4 = **Friday**

**Answer:** **Friday** 🎊[^1]

## **Quick Tips \& Tricks** 🧠

- Remember the odd days for each month for fast calculation.
- For century years, check divisibility by 400 for leap years.
- Use day codes for quick addition.
- Practice with real dates to get faster!
