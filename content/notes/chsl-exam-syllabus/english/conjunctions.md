## 📙 What are Conjunctions?

- 👉 Conjunctions are words that link other words, phrases, or clauses together. For example,
- 👉 I like cooking and eating, but I don’t like washing dishes afterward.
- 👉 Sophie is clearly exhausted, yet she insists on dancing till dawn.
- 👉 Conjunctions allow you to form complex, elegant sentences and avoid the choppiness of
multiple short sentences.
- 👉 Make sure that the phrases joined by conjunctions are parallel (share the same structure.)

|  |  |
| --------  | -------- |
| **`Incorrect`** | 🚫 I work quickly and am careful. |
| **`Correct`** | ✅ I work quickly and carefully. |

### Coordinating Conjunctions

- 🟨 Coordinating conjunctions allow you to join words, phrases, and clauses of equal
grammatical rank in a sentence.
- 🟨 The most common coordinating conjunctions are: for, and, nor, but, or, yet, and so;
- 🟨 An easy way to remember these, is by using the mnemonic device, **“FANBOYS"**.
  
|  |  |
| --------  | -------- |
| `F` | OR |
| `A` | ND |
| `N` | OR |
| `B` | UT |
| `O` | R |
| `Y` | ET |
| `S` | O |

###### Examples:

| no. | examples |
| --------  | -------- |
| `1` | I’d like pizza or a salad for lunch. |
| `2` | We needed a place to concentrate, so we packed up our things and went to the library. |
| `3` | Jesse didn’t have much money, but she got by. |

**Note**: 👀 Notice the use of the comma when a coordinating conjunction is joining two independent
clauses.

### Correlative Conjunctions

- 🟧 Correlative conjunctions are pairs of conjunctions that work together.
- 🟧 Some examples are: either/or, neither/nor, and not only/but also.

###### Example:

| no. | examples |
| --------  | -------- |
| `1` | Not only am I finished studying for English, but I’m also finished writing my history essay. |
| `2` | I am finished with both my English essay and my history essay. |

### Subordinating Conjunctions 

- 🟦 Subordinating conjunctions join independent and dependent clauses.
- 🟦 A subordinating conjunction can signal a cause-and-effect relationship, a contrast, or some
other kind of relationship between the clauses.
- 🟦 Common subordinating conjunctions are:
  
| Because | As | Though | Whereas |
| --------  | -------- | -------- | -------- |
  
| Since | Although | While | 
| --------  | -------- | -------- |

- 🟦 Sometimes an adverb can function as a conjunction, such as:
  - `Until`
  - `After`
  - `Before`
  
###### Example:

|  |  |
| --------  | -------- |
| `1` | I can stay out until the clock strikes twelve. |
| - Exaplanation: | Here, the adverb until functions as a coordinating conjunction to connect two ideas: I can stay out (the independent clause) and the clock strikes twelve (the dependent clause). |

**Note**: 👀 The independent clause could stand alone as a sentence; the dependent clause depends on
the independent clause to make sense.

- The subordinating conjunction doesn’t need to go in the middle of the sentence.
- It has to be part of the dependent clause, but the dependent clause can come before the
independent clause.
- The subordinating conjunction doesn’t need to go in the middle of the sentence.
- It has to be part of the dependent clause, but the dependent clause can come before the
independent clause.

###### Example:

|  |  |
| --------  | -------- |
| `1` | Before he leaves, make sure his room is clean. |

*️⃣ If the dependent clause comes first, use a comma before the independent clause.

###### Example:

|  |  |
| --------  | -------- |
| `1` | <u>I drank a glass of water</u> because I was thirsty. (independent clause 1st) |
| `2` | <u>Because I was thirsty</u>, I drank a glass of water. (dependent clause 1st) |

### Rules for Using a Coordinating Conjunction

#### ⚡Rule #1

- Put a comma before the coordinating conjunction when it is used to connect two independent clauses.
- A clause is a group of words that contain a subject and a verb.
- An independent clause (or main clause) expresses a complete thought. It can stand alone as a sentence.

###### Example:

|  |  |
| --------  | -------- |
| `1` | I like apples. |

⚡A dependent clause does not express a complete thought. It cannot stand alone as a sentence.

###### Example:

|  |  |
| --------  | -------- |
| `1` | “that I saw last month.” |

###### Example of Independent Clauses:

|  |  |
| --------  | -------- |
| `1` | Tom walked the dog. |
| Explanation: | It is an independent clause **Subject**: `Tom` **Verb**: `walked` |
| `2` | Tom grabbed the mail. |
| Explanation: | It is an independent clause Subject: Tom Verb: grabbed |

⚡These two independent clauses can be combined with a coordinating conjunction. When we combine these two sentences, the second "Tom" will be changed to "he."

|  |  |
| --------  | -------- |
| `1` | Tom walked the dog. |
| Explanation: | It is an independent clause **Subject**: `Tom` **Verb**: `walked` |
| `2` | Tom grabbed the mail. |
| Explanation: | It is an independent clause Subject: Tom Verb: grabbed |

###### Here are a few more examples of coordinating conjunctions connecting independent clauses.

|  |  |
| --------  | -------- |
| **`Incorrect`** | 🚫 I want to go see a movie but my sister has my car. |
| **`Correct`** | ✅ I want to go see a movie, but my sister has my car. |

|  |  |
| --------  | -------- |
| **`Incorrect`** | 🚫 Lisa loves cats yet she does not want one living in her house. |
| **`Correct`** | ✅ Lisa loves cats, yet she does not want one living in her house. |

#### ⚡Rule #2

- When using a coordinating conjunction to connect two items, do not use a comma.
- In the example above with Tom and his dog, we can leave out the comma if we do not have two independent clauses.
- We do this by leaving out the subject in the second part of the sentence (he).

|  |  |
| --------  | -------- |
| `1` | Tom walked the dog and grabbed the mail. |
| Explanation: | "Tom walked the dog" is an independent clause, but "grabbed the mail" is not. |

###### Here are a few more examples of how to use a coordinating conjunction to connect two items that are not independent clauses.

|  |  |
| --------  | -------- |
| **`Incorrect`** | 🚫 She likes apples, and bananas. |
| **`Correct`** | ✅ She likes apples and bananas. |

|  |  |
| --------  | -------- |
| **`Incorrect`** | 🚫 My brother is young, but smart. |
| **`Correct`** | ✅ My brother is young but smart. |

#### ⚡Rule #3 

- When using a coordinating conjunction with a list of items (three or more in number), the comma before the coordinating conjunction is optional.
- You should put or leave out the comma before the coordinating conjunction based on the style guide you are using.
  
###### Example with a comma:

|  |  |
| --------  | -------- |
| 1 | <mark>She is cooking chicken, potatoes, corn, and carrot.</mark> OR <mark>She is cooking chicken, potatoes, corn and carrot.</mark> |

### How to Use Conjunctions 🧠

##### ⚡Lest – Should

- Lest _________ should
- "Not" is included in the word "lest".
- It has negativity in itself so we can’t use "not" with this word in a sentence.

###### Examples:

|  |  |
| --------  | -------- |
| **`Incorrect`** | 🚫 I was afraid to open the door *lest* he would follow me. |
| **`Correct`** | ✅ I was afraid to open the door *lest* he **should** follow me. |

|  |  |
| --------  | -------- |
| **`Incorrect`** | 🚫 Work hard lest you should not fail. |
| **`Correct`** | ✅ Work hard lest you should fail. |

##### ⚡So – As

- So ________ as
- It shows negativity in a sentence.
- We use these words to show negativity.

###### Examples:

##### ⚡Other - Than

##### ⚡Either - or/ Neither - nor/ Not only - but also

- Either __________ or
- Neither _________no
- Not only ________but also
- There can be three types of error in these conjunctions for instance. We can trace certain common errors in the aforementioned conjunctions.

###### We can’t use either with nor and neither with or. For example:

| --------  | -------- |
| **`Incorrect`** | 🚫 Either you nor your brother has won the prize. |
| **`Correct`** | ✅ Either you or your brother has won the prize. |

|  |  |

| **`Correct`** | ✅ Unfortunately, neither the red sweater nor the blue sweater are currently available. |

#### ⚡As long as/With/Along with/Together

- When we add two subjects with these words, then we need to focus on the form of verb because in these types of sentences we should use verb according to the first subject

###### Example:

|  |  |

- We use as if and as though to make comparisons. They have a similar meaning.
- We use as if and as though to talk about an imaginary situation or a situation that may not be true but that is likely or possible. As if is more common than as though.

| **`Correct`** | ✅ He acts as if he were a prince. |

| **`Correct`** | ✅ She felt a pain as though a knife had pierced her heart. |

#### The reason/why…that

- After the reason/the reason why we must use "that" in a sentence because sometimes we can see "due to, because, on account of" etc. after the reason/the reason why.

#### Unless

- It is used as a conjunction in the meaning of (if not) – condition/situation.
- Until: it used for time.
