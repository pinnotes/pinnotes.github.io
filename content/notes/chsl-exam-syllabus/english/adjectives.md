## 📙 ADJECTIVES - DEGREES OF COMPARISON & EXCEPTIONS

### Adjectives

*️⃣ The simplest way to explain adjectives is that they describe a noun.

*️⃣ It gives us a better idea of the noun, by telling us its size, shape, age, colour, or other quality.
Example: That is a big tree.

### How to order adjectives in English

If a sentence has more than one adjective, they are arranged by priority, wherein the adjectives that actively describe the noun come before the more neutral nouns.

1. Quantity or number
2. Quality or opinion
3. Size
4. Age
5. Shape
6. Color
7. Proper Adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)
8. Purpose or qualifier
   
**Example**: I love that big, old, green, antique car that is parked at the end of the street.

*Big* describes the size of the car. Since, size is number 3 in the list, it comes before number (4) age
(old) and (6) colour (green).

#### `Degrees of Adjectives`

There are *three* `degrees of adjectives`.

1. **Positive** Adjective
2. **Comparative** Adjective
3. **Superlative** Adjective
   
#### Positive Degree

`Tom` is *tall* a boy.

- In this sentence the word *‘tall’* is an adjective telling us how `Tom` is.
- There is no other person or thing in this sentence used to compare `Tom` with, but it is the general way of saying about persons, animals and things that they have some quality (here ‘tallness’) above average in general sense.
- The adjective word *‘tall’* is said to be in the “positive form”.
- This comparison is called **“positive degree”** comparison.

#### Comparatives

- 1️⃣ One way to describe nouns (people, objects, animals, etc.) is by comparing them to something else.
- ➡️ When comparing two things, you’re likely to use adjectives like smaller, bigger, taller, more interesting, and less expensive.
- 🔔 Notice the ‑er ending, and the words more and less.

See the sentences below for an illustration of this common error: 👀

| `Correct Use` | ✅ His cat is larger than my dog. |
| --------  | -------- |
| `Incorrect Use` | 🚫 His cat is more larger than my dog. |

So, what makes the first example wrong and the second right? There are a few rules that ex- plain this:

- For adjectives that are just one syllable, add -er to the end (this explains the above example).
- For two-syllable adjectives not ending in -y and for all three-or-more-syllable adjectives, use the form “more + adjective.”
- For two-syllable adjectives ending in -y, change the -y to -i and add -er.

👉 These simple rules make it easy to tell when you should add -er or -ier and when you should use “more + adjective.”

##### Examples:

| `Correct Use` | ✅ This house is more exciting than ever |
| --------  | -------- |
| `Incorrect Use` | 🚫 This house is excitinger than ever. |

| `Correct Use` | ✅ Mike is funnier than Isaac. |
| --------  | -------- |
| `Incorrect Use` | 🚫 Mike is more funny than Isaac. |

> [!TIP]
> Notice the spelling change for adjectives ending in ‑y: the comparative ends in ‑ier.

| `Correct Use` | ✅ This book is more boring than the last one. |
| --------  | -------- |
| `Incorrect Use` | 🚫 This book is boringer than the last one |

| `Correct Use` | ✅ Advertising pressures women to be thinner. |
| --------  | -------- |
| `Incorrect Use` | 🚫 Advertising pressures women to be more thin. |

#### Superlatives

- When comparing more than two things, you’ll likely use words and phrases like smallest, biggest, tallest, most interesting, and least interesting.
- Notice the ‑est ending and the words most and least.
- Make sure you use the proper ending or superlative adjective when forming these superlatives

##### Examples:

| no. | The examples below illustrate the correct form: ⤵️ |
| --------  | -------- |
| `1` | Martha is the elder of the four sisters. |
| `2` | If there were only two sisters, we could use the comparative elder here. Because there are four sisters, we need a superlative. |
| `3` | Martha is the eldest of the four sisters. |
| `4` | I think his last book is his least interesting; his third book was the most interesting. |
| `5` | That must be the weirdest play ever written. |

- Remember that adjectives ending in ‑y change their spelling when ‑est is added.
- To form these superlatives, change the y to an i before adding the -est ending, as illustrated below:
  
| `Incorrect Use` 🚫 | `Correct Use` ✅ |
| --------  | -------- |
| That is the sleepyest puppy of the litter. | That is the sleepiest puppy of the litter. |

##### Forming Comparative and Superlatives of Irregular Adjectives

*️⃣ It’s important to note that there are irregular adjectives (and adverbs) that you have to memorize
because they don’t follow the rules above. They are:

| Adjective/Adverb | Comparative | Superlative |
| --------  | -------- | -------- |
| good/well | better | best |
| good/well | better | best |
| good/well | better | best |
| good/well | better | best |
