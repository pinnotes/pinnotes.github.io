## 📙 Rules for Adverbs

### What do Adverbs modify ❔

An adverb is a word that modifies or describes:

|  |  |
| --------  | -------- |
| - A verb | 🟰 he sings louadly |
| - An adjective | 🟰 he sings louadly |
| - Another adverb | 🟰 he sings louadly |
| - Or even a whole sentence | 🟰 he sings louadly |

*️⃣ Adverbs often end in -ly, but some look exactly the same as their adjective counterparts. Take for
example, fast, quick, bad, good, and so on.

###### Examples

1. Tom Longboat did not run badly.
2. Tom is very tall.
3. The race finished too quickly
   
#### #️⃣ Rule # 1

👉 Many adverbs end in -ly, but many do not. Generally, if a word can have -ly added to its adjective
form, place it there to form an adverb.

###### Examples

1. She thinks quick/quickly. => How does she think? Quickly.
2. She is a quick/quickly thinker. => Quick is an adjective describing thinker, so no -ly is
attached.
3. She thinks fast/fastly. => Fast answers the question how, so it is an adverb. But fast never has
-ly attached to it

#### #️⃣ Rule # 2

👉 Adverbs that answer the question ‘how’ sometimes cause grammatical problems. It can be a
challenge to determine if -ly should be attached.

🫷 Avoid the trap of -ly with linking verbs such as taste, smell, look, feel, which pertain to the senses.
Adverbs are often misplaced in such sentences, which require adjectives instead.

###### Examples:

1. Roses smell sweet/sweetly => In this case, smell is a linking verb—which requires an
adjective to modify roses—so no -ly
2. The woman looked angry/angrily to us => Did the woman look with her eyes, or are we
describing her appearance? We are describing her appearance (she appeared angry), so no
-ly
3. The woman looked angry/angrily at the paint splotches. => Here the woman actively looked
(used her eyes), so the -ly is added.
4. She feels bad/badly about the news. => She is not feeling with fingers, so no -ly
   
#### #️⃣ Rule # 3

👉 The word good is an adjective, whose adverb equivalent is well.

###### Examples:

1. You did a good job. => Good describes the job.
2. You smell good today. => Good describes your fragrance, not how you smell with your nose,
so using the adjective is correct.
3. You smell well for someone with a cold. => You are actively smelling with your nose here, so
use the adverb.

#### #️⃣ Rule # 4

👉 The word well can be an adjective, too. When referring to health, we often use well rather than
good.

###### Examples:

1. You do not look well today.
2. I don’t feel well, either.
   
#### #️⃣ Rule # 5

👉 Adjectives come in three forms, also called degrees. An adjective in its normal or usual form is
called a positive degree adjective. A common error in using adjectives and adverbs arises from using
the wrong form of comparison.

###### Examples:

1. She is the cleverer of the two women (never cleverest).

{{< border >}}

**Point to Remember** 

The word cleverest is what is called the superlative form of clever. Use it only when comparing three or more things. 
For example - She is the cleverest of them all. 

{{< /border >}}


|  |  |
| --------  | -------- |
| **`Incorrect Use`** | 🚫 Chocolate or vanilla: which do you like best? |
| **`Correct Use`** | ✅ Chocolate or vanilla: which do you like better? |

#### #️⃣ Rule # 6

👉 There are also three degrees of adverbs. In formal usage, do not drop the -ly from an adverb when
using the comparative form.

###### Examples:

|  |  |
| --------  | -------- |
| **`Incorrect Use`** | 🚫 Talk quieter. |
| **`Correct Use`** | ✅ Talk more quietly. |

|  |  |
| --------  | -------- |
| **`Incorrect Use`** | 🚫 She spoke quicker than he did. |
| **`Correct Use`** | ✅ She spoke more quickly than he did. |

#### #️⃣ Rule # 7

👉 When this, that, these, and those are followed by a noun, they are adjectives. When they appear
without a noun following them, they are pronouns.

###### Examples:

1. This house is for sale. => This is an adjective and a pronoun as well.

#### #️⃣ Rule # 8

👉 Use of ‘Much’ and ‘Very’ - ‘Much’ qualifies adjectives or adverbs in the comparative degree; ‘ very’
in the positive.

###### Examples:

1. The air is much hotter today than yesterday.
2. This book is much heavier than that.
3. This book is very useful.
4. He spoke very loudly.
   
#### #️⃣ Rule # 9

👉 Use of hard, hardly, scarce, scarcely.

###### Examples:

1. **Hard** – as an adverb means ‘Diligently’. It usually follows the verb. For example,
   - He works hard to make both ends meet.
   - Our team played hard in Pakistan.
   - I tried hard to succeed.
2. **Hardly** - When used as an adverb means scarcely, barely. It conveys a negative meaning/
Hardly and scarcely are followed by when. For example,
   - Hardly (Scarcely) had he reached the station, when the train left.
3. **Scarce** - As an adjective means ‘not plentiful, hard to find, not often found. For example,
   - Coal has become scarce in England.
4. **Scarcely** – as an adverb is almost synonymous to ‘Hardly’. For example,
   - I can scarcely hear you.
   - They have scarcely enough to look after their children

#### #️⃣ Rule # 10

👉 Adverb ‘As’ is used with the following verbs - Regard, Describe, define, treat, view, know.

👉 Adverb ‘As’ is not used with the following verbs - Name, elect, think, consider, call, appoint, make,
choose.

###### Examples:

1. I regard him as my mentor.
2. Biology is defined as the study of organisms.
   
#### #️⃣ Rule # 11

👉 Else’ should be followed by ‘but’

###### Examples

|  |  |
| --------  | -------- |
| **`Incorrect Use`** | 🚫 It is nothing else than pride. |
| **`Correct Use`** | ✅  It is nothing else but pride. |

|  |  |
| --------  | -------- |
| **`Incorrect Use`** | 🚫 You do nothing else except feel sorry for yourself. |
| **`Correct Use`** | ✅ You do nothing else but feel sorry for yourself. |
