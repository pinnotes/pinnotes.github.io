## üìô ACTIVE AND PASSIVE VOICE

### What is Voice of a verb‚ùî

The voice of a verb expresses whether the *subject* in the sentence has `performed` or `received the action`.

**For example**:

- The watchman opens the door.
- The door is opened by the watchman.

##### Active Voice 

In the **active voice**, the *subject* of the sentence `performs the action` expressed by the verb. The structure of an active voice sentence is typically: ¬† 

##### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Subject + Verb + Object ¬† 

##### Here are some examples 

* The dog (subject) chased (verb) the ball (object).
* She (subject) wrote (verb) a letter (object).
* The wind (subject) blew (verb) the leaves (object).

##### Passive Voice

When the action expressed by the verb is received by the subject, it is passive voice.
Passive voice is used when the doer of the action is not known and the focus of the sentence
is on the action and not the subject. 

##### For example

* Eggs are laid by hens.
* Nests are built by birds.

### Active and Passive Voice Rules for Conversion of Sentence 

Below are the active-passive voice rules to follow for changing an active sentence into a passive voice. Before heading to the rules of active-passive voice, let‚Äôs check the examples of active and passive voice sentences.

### Conversion of Active and Passive voice examples üëÄ

- **Active voice** - Rita wrote a letter. (Subject + Verb + Object)
- **Passive voice** - A letter was written by Rita. (Object) + (auxiliary verb) + (past participle) + (by subject).
- **Active voice** - She cooks food. (Subject + Verb + Object)
- **Passive voice** - The food is cooked by her. (Object) + (auxiliary verb) + (past participle) + (by subject)
  
### #Ô∏è‚É£ Rule #1 

‚û°Ô∏è Identify the (S+V+O) Subject, Verb and object in the active sentence to convert to passive voice.

**Example**: He drives car. (Subject ‚Äì He, verb ‚Äì Drives, object ‚Äì Car)
  
### #Ô∏è‚É£ Rule #2

‚û°Ô∏è Interchange the object and subject with each other, i.e., object of the active sentence become the
subject of the passive sentence.

#### Example

**Active voice** - She knits sweater. (Subject ‚Äì She, Verb ‚Äì Knits, Object ‚Äì Sweater).
**Passive voice** -  The sweater is knitted by her. (Object sweater is interchanged with the subject She).

  
### #Ô∏è‚É£ Rule #3

‚û°Ô∏è In passive voice sometimes the subject is not used, i.e., the subject in passive voice can be omitted
if the sentence without it gives enough meaning.

**Example**: Milk is sold in litres
  
### #Ô∏è‚É£ Rule #4

‚û°Ô∏è Change the base verb in the active sentence into the past participle i.e., third form verb in a passive
sentence i.e., preceded by (By, With, to, etc). Base verbs are never used in passive voice sentences.


#### Examples

- **Active voice** - She prepares dinner.
- **Passive voice** - The dinner is prepared *by* her.
- **Active voice** - She knows him.
- **Passive voice** -  He is known *to* her
- **Active voice** -  Juice fills the jar.
- **Passive voice** - The jar is filled *with* juice.


### #Ô∏è‚É£ Rule #5

‚û°Ô∏è While conversion of Active voice sentence to Passive voice sentence, the pronoun used in the
sentence also changes in the following manner.

| Active Voice Pronoun   | Passive Voice Pronoun | 
| --------  | -------- |
| I | Me |
| We | Us |
| He | Him |
| She | Her |
| They | Them |
| You | You |
| It | It |

### #Ô∏è‚É£ Rule #6

‚û°Ô∏è Use the suitable helping or auxiliary verb (is/am/are/was, etc.). The rules for using auxiliary verbs in
passive voice sentences are different for each tense.

#### For example

* The letter is written by her.
* A book was not bought by her
* Chocolates are being eaten by them.
