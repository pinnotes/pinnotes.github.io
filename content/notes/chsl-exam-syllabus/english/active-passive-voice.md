## ACTIVE AND PASSIVE VOICE

#### What is Voice of a verb?

* The voice of a verb expresses whether the *subject* in the sentence has `performed` or `received the action`. For example,
  * The watchman opens the door.
  * The door is opened by the watchman.

##### Active Voice

In the **active voice**, the *subject* of the sentence `performs the action` expressed by the verb. The structure of an active voice sentence is typically:   

##### Subject + Verb + Object   

###### Here are some examples:

* The dog (subject) chased (verb) the ball (object).
* She (subject) wrote (verb) a letter (object).
* The wind (subject) blew (verb) the leaves (object).
