## **Key Definitions**

- **Interest**: The extra amount paid for borrowing money or received for lending money.
- **Principal (P)**: The original amount borrowed or lent.
- **Amount (A)**: The total sum after adding interest to the principal ($A = P + \text{Interest}$).
- **Rate of Interest (r)**: The percentage charged or earned on the principal per year.
- **Time (t)**: The period for which money is borrowed or deposited (usually in years).

## **Types of Interest**

### **Simple Interest (SI)**

- **Definition**: Interest calculated only on the principal for every year.
- **Formula**:

$$
SI = \frac{P \times r \times t}{100}
$$

Where:
    - $P$ = Principal
    - $r$ = Rate per annum
    - $t$ = Time in years

**Cheatsheet:**

- If time is in months: \$ t = \frac{months}{12} \$
- If time is in days: \$ t = \frac{days}{365} \$

**Example:**
> Q: Rs.1080 invested for 3 months gave an interest of Rs.27. What is the annual rate?
>
> Solution: \$ t = \frac{3}{12} = 0.25 \$ years
> \$ 27 = \frac{1080 \times r \times 0.25}{100} \$
> \$ r = 10\% \$

### **Compound Interest (CI)**

- **Definition**: Interest calculated on the principal plus accumulated interest.
- **Formula for Amount (A):**

$$
A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{100}\right)^t
$$
- **Compound Interest:**

$$
CI = A - P
$$

**Special Cases:**

- **Compounded Half-Yearly:** Use \$ r/2 \$ and \$ 2t \$

$$
A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{2 \times 100}\right)^{2t}
$$
- **Compounded Quarterly:** Use \$ r/4 \$ and \$ 4t \$

$$
A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{4 \times 100}\right)^{4t}
$$
- **Variable Rates:** For different rates each year:

$$
A = P \left(1 + \frac{r_1}{100}\right)\left(1 + \frac{r_2}{100}\right)\left(1 + \frac{r_3}{100}\right)...
$$

**Example 1:**
> Q: Find CI on Rs.50,000 at 12% per annum for 1 year, compounded half-yearly.
>
> Solution: \$ r = 6\% \$, \$ t = 2 \$
> \$ A = 50,000 \left(1 + \frac{6}{100}\right)^2 = 50,000 \times 1.1236 = 56,180 \$
> \$ CI = 56,180 - 50,000 = 6,180 \$

**Example 2:**
> Q: Rs.25,000 at CI for 3 years at rates 4%, 8%, 10% for each year.
>
> Solution:
> \$ A = 25,000 \times 1.04 \times 1.08 \times 1.10 = 30,888 \$

## **Comparison Table: Simple vs. Compound Interest**

| Feature | Simple Interest (SI) | Compound Interest (CI) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Formula | \$ \frac{P \times r \times t}{100} \$ | \$ P \left(1 + \frac{r}{100}\right)^t - P \$ |
| Interest on | Principal only | Principal + Accumulated Interest |
| Growth | Linear | Exponential |

## **Shortcuts and Effective Rate**

- **Effective Rate for 2 years at r%:**
\$ Effective Rate = r + r + \frac{r^2}{100} \$
- **Difference between CI and SI for 2 years:**
\$ D = \frac{P \times r^2}{100^2} \$

**Example:**
> Q: Difference between CI and SI on Rs.3,000 at 10% for 2 years?
>
> Solution: \$ D = \frac{3,000 \times 10^2}{100^2} = 30 \$

---

## **Tree Method for CI**

- Assume a simple principal (like Rs.100 or Rs.1,000) to make calculations easier.
- Calculate interest for each year, including interest on previous interest.

**Example:**
> Q: CI for Rs.10,000 at 10% for 3 years.
>
> Year 1: \$ 1,000 \$
> Year 2: \$ 1,100 \$ (1,000 + 100)
> Year 3: \$ 1,210 \$ (1,000 + 100 + 100 + 10)
> Total: \$ 1,000 + 1,100 + 1,210 = 3,310 \$

---

## **Installments**

- Used for calculating the price when paying in equal installments with interest.

**Example:**
> Q: Oven bought in 4 installments of Rs.2,500 at 10% SI. What is the price?
>
> Solution: Assume installment is Rs.100, total payments = 460
> Actual price = \$ 2,500 \times \frac{460}{100} = 11,500 \$

## **Practice Questions**

1. Calculate the SI on Rs.2,000 at 8% for 18 months.
2. Find the CI on Rs.5,000 at 10% for 2 years, compounded annually.
3. What is the difference between SI and CI on Rs.1,500 at 12% for 2 years?
4. If Rs.1,200 becomes Rs.1,512 in 2 years at CI, what is the rate?
5. A sum is invested at 5% SI and earns Rs.200 in 4 years. Find the principal.

## **Cheatsheet Summary**

- **SI Formula:** \$ SI = \frac{P \times r \times t}{100} \$
- **CI Formula:** \$ CI = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{100}\right)^t - P \$
- **Effective Rate (2 years):** \$ r + r + \frac{r^2}{100} \$
- **Time Conversion:** Months \$ \rightarrow \$ Years: \$ \frac{months}{12} \$, Days \$ \rightarrow \$ Years: \$ \frac{days}{365} \$
- **Difference (CI - SI, 2 years):** \$ \frac{P \times r^2}{100^2} \$
