## Time and Work: Easy Explanation, Formulas, Examples, Cheatsheets, Practice Questions, Images \& Graphics

This guide simplifies the **Time and Work** topic from your PDF, including core concepts, key formulas, solved examples, a cheatsheet, practice questions (with answers), and visual aids for clarity.

---

## **1. Core Concepts**

- **Work**: Any task to be completed (e.g., building a wall, filling a tank).
- **Time**: Duration taken to finish the work.
- **Efficiency**: Amount of work done per unit time (higher efficiency = less time).

---

## **2. Key Formulas (Cheatsheet)**

| Formula/Rule | Use Case |
| :-- | :-- |
| If A completes work in n days, A’s 1 day work = 1/n | Basic calculation |
| Work = Time × Rate of Work | Find total work done |
| Rate of Work = 1 / Time | Work done per unit time |
| Time = 1 / Rate of Work | Find time from rate |
| Total Work = Efficiency × Number of Days | Work done by a person/group |
| If A is x times as efficient as B, time ratio = 1:x | Comparing times for same work |
| If A \& B together finish in T days: 1/T = 1/A + 1/B | Combined work |
| If A, B, C together: 1/T = 1/A + 1/B + 1/C | Three people together |
| If x men do W1 work in D1 days, x men do W2 in D2 days: | Work/men/days relationship |
| M₁D₁/W₁ = M₂D₂/W₂ |  |
| If A takes x days more than (A+B) and B takes y days more | (A+B) finish in √(xy) days |

## **3. Visual: Work-Time-Efficiency Relationship**

```
      Work
      /   \
  Time   Efficiency
      \   /
   (Inverse)
```

- More efficiency → less time for same work.
- More people → less time for same work.

---

## **4. Solved Examples**

### **Example 1: Two People Working Together**

**Q:** A does a work in 10 days, B in 15 days. How long together?

- A's 1 day work = 1/10
- B's 1 day work = 1/15
- Combined 1 day work = 1/10 + 1/15 = (3+2)/30 = 5/30 = 1/6
- **Together: 6 days**

---

### **Example 2: Finding Individual Time**

**Q:** A alone: 40 days. A+B together: 8 days. How long for B alone?

- A’s 1 day work = 1/40
- Together = 1/8
- B’s 1 day work = 1/8 – 1/40 = (5–1)/40 = 4/40 = 1/10
- **B alone: 10 days**

---

### **Example 3: Three People Together**

**Q:** A+B: 3 days, B+C: 4 days, A+C: 6 days. How long all together?

- A+B: 1/3, B+C: 1/4, A+C: 1/6
- Add: (1/3 + 1/4 + 1/6) = (4+3+2)/12 = 9/12 = 3/4
- All together: 1/2 × 3/4 = 3/8 per day ⇒ **8/3 days**

---

### **Example 4: Efficiency Ratio**

**Q:** A is thrice as efficient as B. Together finish in 12 days. B alone?

- Let B’s time = x, A’s = x/3
- 1/x + 1/(x/3) = 1/12 ⇒ (1 + 3)/x = 1/12 ⇒ 4/x = 1/12 ⇒ x = 48
- **B alone: 48 days**

---

### **Example 5: Alternate Days**

**Q:** A: 10 days, B: 15 days, work alternately starting with A. Days to finish?

- A’s 1 day: 1/10, B’s: 1/15, 2 days: 1/10 + 1/15 = 1/6
- 6 cycles (12 days) = 1 work done
- **Total: 12 days**

---

## **5. Practice Questions with Answers**

1. **A can do a work in 12 days, B in 16 days. Together?**
*A’s 1 day: 1/12, B’s: 1/16, Together: 1/12+1/16=7/48 → **6.86 days***
2. **A+B: 20 days, B alone: 30 days. A alone?**
*1/20 – 1/30 = 1/60 → **60 days***
3. **A is twice as efficient as B. Together: 18 days. A alone?**
*Let B = x, A = x/2; 1/x + 2/x = 1/18 → x = 54, A = 27 days*
4. **15 men do a job in 8 days. After 3 days, 3 more join. Remaining days?**
*Total work: 120 units. Done: 45 units. Left: 75 units. New men: 18. 75/18 = 4.17 days*
5. **1200 soldiers have food for 28 days. After 4 days, some leave, food lasts 32 more days. How many left?**
*x = 300 soldiers left*

---

## **6. Tricks \& Shortcuts**

- **If A is x times as efficient as B, A’s time : B’s time = 1:x**
- **Combined work for n people:** 1/Total days = 1/x₁ + 1/x₂ + ... + 1/xₙ
- **Work and wages:** Wages are divided in the ratio of work done (or efficiency).

## **7. Images \& Graphics**

### **A. Work Distribution Bar**

```
|----------|----------|----------|
A (10d)    B (15d)    Together (6d)
```


### **B. Pie Chart: Work Done Per Day**

If A = 1/10 per day, B = 1/15 per day:

- A: 60%
- B: 40%

---

## **8. Summary Table**

| Situation | Formula/Approach |
| :-- | :-- |
| A alone: n days | 1/n per day |
| A+B together: t days | 1/t per day |
| A’s share in work/wages | Efficiency ratio |
| More men, less days | M₁D₁ = M₂D₂ |
| Men, Days, Hours, Work | M₁D₁H₁/W₁ = M₂D₂H₂/W₂ |


---

## **9. Final Tips**

- **Always express work in “per day” or “per hour” units.**
- **Use ratios to compare efficiency and time.**
- **For alternate day problems, sum cycles and add remaining work if needed.**
- **Practice with a variety of problems for speed and accuracy.**
