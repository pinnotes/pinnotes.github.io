## **1. What is a Percentage?**

- **Definition:** A percentage is a fraction with a denominator of 100, denoted by the symbol **%**.
- **Example:** \$ 10\% = \frac{10}{100} = 0.1 \$[^1].

---

## **2. Key Formulas and Conversions**

### **A. Basic Percentage Formula**

- To find \$ y\% \$ of \$ x \$:

$$
y\% \text{ of } x = x \times \frac{y}{100}
$$

**Example:** \$ 25\% \$ of \$ 200 = 200 \times \frac{25}{100} = 50 \$[^1][^4].


### **B. Expressing Fractions as Percentages**

- \$ \frac{a}{b} \$ as a percent:

$$
\frac{a}{b} \times 100\%
$$

**Example:** \$ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \$[^1][^4].


### **C. Expressing Percentages as Fractions**

- \$ x\% = \frac{x}{100} \$
**Example:** \$ 30\% = \frac{30}{100} = \frac{3}{10} \$[^1][^4].


### **D. Increase/Decrease by a Percentage**

- **Increase by \$ x\% \$:** Multiply by \$ \frac{100 + x}{100} \$
- **Decrease by \$ x\% \$:** Multiply by \$ \frac{100 - x}{100} \$[^1].


### **E. Percentage Change**

- **Increase:** \$ \frac{Final Value - Initial Value}{Initial Value} \times 100 \$
- **Decrease:** \$ \frac{Initial Value - Final Value}{Initial Value} \times 100 \$[^1].

## **5. Important Concepts and Tricks**

- **Expressing One Quantity as a Percent of Another:**

$$
\left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \times 100 \right) \%
$$
- **If A is X% more than B, then B is \$ \frac{X}{100+X} \times 100\% \$ less than A.**
- **If A is X% less than B, then B is \$ \frac{X}{100-X} \times 100\% \$ more than A.**[^1]

---

## **6. Solved Examples**

### **Example 1: Find the Number from a Percentage**

**Q:** If \$ 40\% \$ of \$ P = 100 \$, find \$ P \$.

$$
P \times \frac{40}{100} = 100 \implies P = \frac{100 \times 100}{40} = 250
$$

[^1]

---

### **Example 2: Fraction to Percentage**

**Q:** Express \$ \frac{1}{5} \$ as a percentage.

$$
\frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20\%
$$

[^1]

---

### **Example 3: Percentage Increase**

**Q:** A number increases from 50 to 65. What is the percentage increase?

$$
\frac{65-50}{50} \times 100 = \frac{15}{50} \times 100 = 30\%
$$

---

### **Example 4: Percentage of Marks**

**Q:** A student scores 476 out of 500 marks. What is the percentage?

$$
\frac{476}{500} \times 100 = 95.2\%
$$

## **8. Advanced Percentage Tricks**

- **Successive Percentage Change:**
If a value is increased by \$ a\% \$ and then by \$ b\% \$, the net change is:

$$
\text{Net } \% = a + b + \frac{ab}{100}
$$

**Example:** Increase by 20%, then 10%:
\$ 20 + 10 + \frac{20 \times 10}{100} = 32\% \$ increase.
- **Population Change Formula:**
For population \$ P \$, increasing at \$ R\% \$ per annum for \$ n \$ years:

$$
\text{Future Population} = P \times \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^n
$$

For decrease, use minus sign.

## **9. Percentage in Data Interpretation**

Percentages are widely used in pie charts, bar graphs, and tables. For example, if a sector in a pie chart is 90°, it represents \$ \frac{90}{360} \times 100 = 25\% \$ of the total[^2].

## **10. Summary Table: Percentage Formulas**

| Purpose | Formula |

| Increase by x% | \$ Number \times \frac{100+x}{100} \$ |
| Decrease by x% | \$ Number \times \frac{100-x}{100} \$ |
| % Increase/Decrease | \$ \frac{Change}{Original} \times 100 \$ |
| Successive % change | \$ a + b + \frac{ab}{100} \$ |
