### **Important Formulas \& Rules** 📏

- **Profit Sharing (Same Time):**
If A invests ₹x and B invests ₹y for the same period:

$$
\text{A's share} : \text{B's share} = x : y
$$
- **Profit Sharing (Different Times):**
If A invests ₹x for p months, B invests ₹y for q months:

$$
\text{A's share} : \text{B's share} = x \times p : y \times q
$$
- **Share of Profit:**

$$
\text{A's share} = \frac{\text{A's investment} \times \text{A's time}}{\text{Total weighted investment}} \times \text{Total profit}
$$

### **Step-by-Step Example with Emojis** 🧑‍🏫

Suppose:

- A invests ₹10,000 for 12 months
- B invests ₹12,000 for 10 months
- C invests ₹7,200 for 8 months

Their profit sharing ratio:

- A: 10,000 × 12 = 120,000
- B: 12,000 × 10 = 120,000
- C: 7,200 × 8 = 57,600

So, **A:B:C = 120,000 : 120,000 : 57,600 = 25 : 25 : 12** 📊

#### **Q1.**

**Raghwendra’s investment is twice Bhanu’s and thrice Chitra’s. Bhanu invested for twice the months as Raghwendra and thrice as Chitra. Who earns the highest profit?**
(A) Bhanu
(B) Chitra
(C) Raghwendra
(D) Both Raghu and Bhanu

**Solution:**

- Investment ratio: Raghwendra:Bhanu:Chitra = 6:3:2

- Multiply investment × time for each:
    - R = 6×3 = 18
    - B = 3×6 = 18
    - C = 2×2 = 4
- Final ratio: 18:18:4 → 9:9:2

#### **Q2.**

**B, Q, and R start a business in ratio 4:3:6. B and Q start, R joins after 6 months. R gets ₹3,600/month salary for 6 months, which is 10% of annual profit. What is Q’s share?**
(A) ₹51,000
(B) ₹58,320
(C) ₹57,900
(D) ₹60,600

**Solution:**

- R’s salary: 3,600 × 6 = ₹21,600
- ₹21,600 is 10% of profit → Total profit = ₹216,000
- Investment × time:
    - B: 4×12 = 48
    - Q: 3×12 = 36
