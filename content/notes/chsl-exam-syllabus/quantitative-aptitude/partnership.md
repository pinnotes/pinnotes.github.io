## **1. What is a Partnership?**

- **Partnership**: When two or more people invest money in a business together, each is called a *partner*, and their relationship is called a *partnership*. The money invested is called *capital*.
- **Simple Partnership**: All partners invest for the same duration.
- **Compound/Complex Partnership**: Partners invest for different durations.

---

## **2. Types of Partners**

- **Working (Active) Partner**: Manages the business and invests money.
- **Sleeping (Silent) Partner**: Only invests money, does not manage the business.

---

## **3. Key Formulas (Cheatsheet)**

### **A. Profit Sharing**

- **Same Time Investment**:
If A invests Rs. $x$, B invests Rs. $y$:

$$
\text{A's share} : \text{B's share} = x : y
$$
- **Different Time Investment**:
If A invests Rs. $x$ for $p$ months, B invests Rs. $y$ for $q$ months:

$$
\text{A's share} : \text{B's share} = x \times p : y \times q
$$
- **Total Profit Distribution**:
If A invests $A_1$ for $t_1$ months, B invests $A_2$ for $t_2$ months, and total profit is $P$:

$$
\text{A's share} = \frac{A_1 t_1}{A_1 t_1 + A_2 t_2} \times P
$$

$$
\text{B's share} = \frac{A_2 t_2}{A_1 t_1 + A_2 t_2} \times P
$$


### **B. Working Allowance**

- If a working partner gets a fixed percentage or amount, deduct it from the profit before dividing the rest as per capital ratios.

## **5. Solved Examples**

### **Example 1: Simple Ratio**

**Q:** Gman and Betu invest Rs. 36,000 and Rs. 63,000. Profit is Rs. 5,500. Find each share.

- Ratio: 36,000 : 63,000 = 4 : 7
- Gman's share: \$ \frac{4}{11} \times 5500 = 2000 \$
- Betu's share: \$ \frac{7}{11} \times 5500 = 3500 \$

---

### **Example 2: Different Time Periods**

**Q:** A invests Rs. 50,000, S joins after 3 months with Rs. 70,000. Share profit at year end.

- A: \$ 50,000 \times 12 = 600,000 \$
- S: \$ 70,000 \times 9 = 630,000 \$
- Ratio: 600,000 : 630,000 = 20 : 21

---

### **Example 3: Working Partner Allowance**

**Q:** Manisha (sleeping) invests Rs. 1,80,000, Nida (working) invests Rs. 90,000. Nida gets 14.5% of Rs. 24,000 profit for managing. Find Manisha’s share.

- Nida's allowance: \$ 0.145 \times 24,000 = 3,480 \$
- Remaining profit: \$ 24,000 - 3,480 = 20,520 \$
- Capital ratio: 1,80,000 : 90,000 = 2 : 1
- Manisha's share: \$ \frac{2}{3} \times 20,520 = 13,680 \$

```

- Multiply each partner's capital by months invested for profit share.

---

## **8. Tips \& Tricks**

- **Always convert months to the same unit.**
- **For working partners, deduct their salary/commission before dividing the rest.**
- **For changing investments, split the timeline and calculate shares for each period.**

| Situation | Formula/Rule |
| :-- | :-- |
| Same time investment | Profit share = Capital ratio |
| Different time investment | Profit share = Capital × Time ratio |
| Working partner with allowance | Deduct allowance, divide rest as per capital |
| Partner joins/leaves midway | Split timeline, sum each period’s share |
