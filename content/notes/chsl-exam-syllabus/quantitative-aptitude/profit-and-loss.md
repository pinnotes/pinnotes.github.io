## **1. Key Concepts and Definitions**

| Term | Meaning |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Cost Price (CP)** | The price at which an item is purchased (includes all expenses: purchase, transport, etc.) |
| **Selling Price (SP)** | The price at which the item is sold (money received from the buyer) |
| **Marked Price (MP)** | The price written/tagged on the item (before discount) |
| **Profit (Gain)** | When SP > CP; \$ Profit = SP - CP \$ |
| **Loss** | When SP < CP; \$ Loss = CP - SP \$ |
| **Discount** | Reduction from the marked price; \$ Discount = MP - SP \$ |


---

## **2. Essential Formulas Cheatsheet**

| Quantity | Formula |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Profit** | \$ SP - CP \$ |
| **Loss** | \$ CP - SP \$ |
| **Profit % (on CP)** | \$ \frac{Profit}{CP} \times 100 \$ |
| **Loss % (on CP)** | \$ \frac{Loss}{CP} \times 100 \$ |
| **SP (given Profit %)** | \$ SP = \left(1 + \frac{Profit \%}{100}\right) \times CP \$ |
| **SP (given Loss %)** | \$ SP = \left(1 - \frac{Loss \%}{100}\right) \times CP \$ |
| **CP (given Profit %)** | \$ CP = \frac{100}{100 + Profit \%} \times SP \$ |
| **CP (given Loss %)** | \$ CP = \frac{100}{100 - Loss \%} \times SP \$ |
| **Discount %** | \$ \frac{Discount}{MP} \times 100 \$ |
| **Markup %** | \$ \frac{MP - CP}{CP} \times 100 \$ |
| **Equivalent Discount** | \$ X + Y - \frac{XY}{100} \$ (for successive discounts of X% and Y%) |

## **4. Solved Examples**

### **Example 1: Profit Calculation**

*A shopkeeper buys a pen for Rs. 8 and sells it for Rs. 10.*

- **Profit = SP - CP = 10 - 8 = Rs. 2**
- **Profit % = (2/8) × 100 = 25%**

---

### **Example 2: Loss Calculation**

*A shopkeeper buys juice cans for \$30 each, sells at \$20 each.*

- **Loss = CP - SP = 30 - 20 = \$10**
- **Loss % = (10/30) × 100 = 33.33%**

---

### **Example 3: Discount and Marked Price**

*Marked Price = Rs. 135, Discount = Rs. 27, Find Discount %.*

- **Discount % = (27/135) × 100 = 20%**

---

### **Example 4: Successive Profits**

*Two successive profits of 20% and 10%: Net Profit % = 20 + 10 + (20×10)/100 = 32%*

---

### **Example 5: Cost Price from SP and Profit %**

*SP = Rs. 1140, Loss = 5%. What SP for 5% profit?*

- **CP = 1140 / 0.95 = Rs. 1200**
- **SP for 5% profit = 1200 × 1.05 = Rs. 1260**

---

## **5. Common Tricks and Shortcuts**

- **If cost price of 'a' articles = selling price of 'b' articles:**

$$
\text{Profit \%} = \frac{a-b}{b} \times 100
$$
- **If a person sells two articles at the same price, one with a% gain and other with a% loss:**

$$
\text{Net Loss \%} = \left(\frac{a}{10}\right)^2
$$
- **For false weight (dishonest trader):**

$$
\text{Gain \%} = \frac{\text{Error}}{\text{True Value}} \times 100
$$

## **7. Points to Remember**

- **Profit and loss % are usually calculated on cost price unless stated otherwise.**
- **Discount % is always on marked price.**
- **For successive discounts or profits, use compound formulas.**
- **Always check if the question gives profit/loss/discount on CP, SP, or MP.**

## **8. Quick Reference Table**

| Scenario | Formula/Approach |
| :-- | :-- |
| Profit % on CP | \$ \frac{SP-CP}{CP} \times 100 \$ |
| Loss % on CP | \$ \frac{CP-SP}{CP} \times 100 \$ |
| Discount % | \$ \frac{MP-SP}{MP} \times 100 \$ |
| Markup % | \$ \frac{MP-CP}{CP} \times 100 \$ |
| Successive Profit/Loss | \$ X+Y+\frac{XY}{100} \$ |
| Equal SP, gain/loss a% each | \$ \left(\frac{a}{10}\right)^2 loss \$ |
