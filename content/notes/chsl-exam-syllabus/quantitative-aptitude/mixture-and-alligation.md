## Mixture and Alligation PDF Course: Easy Explanation, Formulas, Examples, Cheatsheet \& Practice

This summary simplifies the key points of the Mixture and Alligation PDF, including core concepts, formulas, worked examples, a cheatsheet, and all practice questions with clear answers.

## **Core Concepts**

**Alligation:**
A rule to find the ratio in which two or more ingredients at given prices must be mixed to obtain a mixture of a desired price.

**Mean Price:**
The cost price per unit of the mixture.

---

## **Key Formula (Alligation Rule)**

If two ingredients A and B cost $x$ and $y$ per unit, and the mean price is $M$:

$$
\text{Required Ratio} = \frac{M - Y}{X - M} = \frac{Y - M}{M - X}
$$

Where:

- $X$ = Cost of cheaper ingredient
- $Y$ = Cost of dearer ingredient
- $M$ = Mean price (desired price of the mixture)

---

## **Worked Examples**

**Example 1:**
*In what ratio must rice costing Rs. 8.50 per kg be mixed with rice costing Rs. 13 per kg so that the mixture is worth Rs. 10 per kg?*

- $X = 8.5$, $Y = 13$, $M = 10$
- Ratio = $\frac{13 - 10}{10 - 8.5} = \frac{3}{1.5} = 2:1$

---

**Example 2:**
*A grocer mixes sugar costing Rs. 60/kg and Rs. 65/kg to sell at Rs. 68.20/kg with 10% profit. Find the ratio.*

- Let cost price of mixture = $M$
- Selling price = Rs. 68.20, Profit = 10%
- Cost price = $68.20 / 1.10 = 62$
- Ratio = $\frac{65 - 62}{62 - 60} = \frac{3}{2} = 3:2$

---

**Example 3:**
*729 litres of a mixture (milk:water = 7:2). How much water to add so that new ratio is 7:3?*

- Milk = $729 \times \frac{7}{9} = 567$ L
- Water = $729 \times \frac{2}{9} = 162$ L
- Let added water = $x$
- $\frac{567}{162 + x} = \frac{7}{3}$ ⇒ $567 \times 3 = 7 \times (162 + x)$ ⇒ $1701 = 1134 + 7x$ ⇒ $7x = 567$ ⇒ $x = 81$ L

---

**Example 4:**
*Three types of rice at Rs. 1.27, Rs. 1.29, Rs. 1.32/kg are mixed to sell at Rs. 1.30/kg. Find the ratio.*

- Use alligation for each pair:
    - (1.32 - 1.30):(1.30 - 1.29) = 0.02:0.01 = 2:1
    - For third, sum accordingly.
- Final ratio: $2:1:5$

---

**Example 5:**
*Mix 4 types of rice (Rs. 95, 60, 90, 50/kg) to get mixture worth Rs. 80/kg.*

- Use alligation stepwise.
- Final ratio: $4:4:5:1$

---

**Replacement Concept Formula:**

When a container of capacity $a$ units has $b$ units replaced $k$ times:

$$
\text{Quantity left} = a \left(1 - \frac{b}{a}\right)^k
$$

**Example 6:**
*8 L drawn from a cask full of wine and replaced with water, repeated 4 times. Wine left to water is 16:65. Find original volume.*

- Let original = $x$
- After 4 times: $x \left(1 - \frac{8}{x}\right)^4 = \frac{16}{81}x$
- Solve: $x = 24$ L

---

## **Cheatsheet**

- **Alligation Ratio:** $\frac{\text{Higher price} - \text{Mean price}}{\text{Mean price} - \text{Lower price}}$
- **Replacement after k operations:** $a \left(1 - \frac{b}{a}\right)^k$
- **For mixtures with more than 2 ingredients:** Apply alligation stepwise for each pair.
