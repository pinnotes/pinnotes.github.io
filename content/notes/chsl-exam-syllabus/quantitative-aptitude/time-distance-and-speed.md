## Speed, Time, and Distance: Easy Explanation, Formulas, Examples, Cheatsheets, Practice Questions, and Visuals

This summary provides a comprehensive, easy-to-understand guide to the **Speed, Time, and Distance** PDF, including definitions, key formulas, solved examples, a cheatsheet, practice questions with answers, and visual aids.

## **1. Core Concepts and Definitions**

| Term | Definition | Units |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Speed | Rate at which distance is covered. | m/s, km/hr |
| Time | Duration taken to cover the distance. | seconds, minutes, hr |
| Distance | Length of the path traveled. | meters, kilometers |

**Key Relationship:**

$$
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
$$

$$
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
$$

$$
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
$$

## **2. Unit Conversions Cheatsheet**

| From | To | Multiply by |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| km/hr | m/s | 5/18 |
| m/s | km/hr | 18/5 |
| 1 mile | km | 1.609 |
| 1 km | mile | 0.6214 |
| 1 hour | seconds | 3600 |
| 1 minute | seconds | 60 |
| 1 mile | yards | 1760 |
| 1 yard | feet | 3 |
| 1 mile | feet | 5280 |

**Example:**
Convert 54 km/hr to m/s:
\$ 54 \times \frac{5}{18} = 15 \$ m/s[^1].

## **3. Key Formulas and Shortcuts**

### **A. Basic Formulas**

- **Speed:** \$ Speed = \frac{Distance}{Time} \$
- **Distance:** \$ Distance = Speed \times Time \$
- **Time:** \$ Time = \frac{Distance}{Speed} \$[^1][^2][^3][^4][^5][^6]


### **B. Average Speed**

- If total distance = \$ d_1 + d_2 + ... \$, total time = \$ t_1 + t_2 + ... \$:

$$
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{d_1 + d_2 + ...}{t_1 + t_2 + ...}
$$
- If equal distances at speeds \$ x \$ and \$ y \$:

$$
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{2xy}{x + y}
$$
- If equal time at speeds \$ x \$ and \$ y \$:

$$
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{x + y}{2}
$$

[^1][^2][^5][^6]

### **C. Relative Speed**

- **Same Direction:** \$ Relative Speed = |x - y| \$
- **Opposite Direction:** \$ Relative Speed = x + y \$
- For trains crossing each other:

$$
\text{Time taken} = \frac{L_1 + L_2}{\text{Relative Speed}}
$$

where \$ L_1, L_2 \$ are lengths of the trains[^3].


### **D. Ratio of Speed/Time**

- If speed ratio is \$ a:b \$, time ratio is \$ b:a \$[^1][^4][^5].

## **4. Visuals and Graphics**

### **A. Relationship Triangle**

```
      Distance
      /      \
Speed ------- Time
```

- Cover any one to get the formula for the other two.


### **B. Speedometer Analogy**

- Think of speed as what a speedometer shows: how fast you cover distance per unit time.

## **5. Solved Examples**

### **Example 1: Unit Conversion**

**Q:** Convert 20 m/s to km/hr.
**A:** \$ 20 \times \frac{18}{5} = 72 \$ km/hr[^1].

---

### **Example 2: Ratio of Times**

**Q:** Speeds of three cars: 5:4:6. Find time ratio for same distance.
**A:** Time ratio = \$ 1/5 : 1/4 : 1/6 = 12 : 15 : 10 \$[^1].

---

### **Example 3: Average Speed (Different Speeds)**

**Q:** A man travels 12 km at 4 km/hr, then 10 km at 5 km/hr. What is the average speed?
**A:**
Time = \$ 12/4 + 10/5 = 3 + 2 = 5 \$ hr
Average speed = \$ (12 + 10)/5 = 22/5 = 4.4 \$ km/hr[^1].

---

### **Example 4: Average Speed (Equal Distances)**

**Q:** 50 km at 50 km/hr, return at 75 km/hr. Average speed?
**A:**
\$ Average speed = \frac{2 \times 50 \times 75}{50 + 75} = 60 \$ km/hr[^1].

## **6. Practice Questions with Answers**

1. **Two people, Shaan (50 km/hr) and Rohan (30 km/hr), start from different places 710 km apart. Shaan starts 3 hours earlier. Where do they meet relative to N?**
**Answer:** 500 km from N[^1].
2. **Two cars depart from A (10 am, 80 km/hr) and B (1 pm, 50 km/hr), 370 km apart. When do they meet?**
**Answer:** 2:00 pm[^1].
3. **A man takes 5 hr 45 min to walk to a place and ride back. If riding both ways, he’d save 2 hours. Time to walk both ways?**
**Answer:** 7 hr 45 min[^1].
4. **A and B start together at 40 km/hr and 50 km/hr. A takes 15 min longer. What’s the journey distance?**
**Answer:** 50 km[^1].
5. **Cyclist covers 750 m in 2 min 30 sec. What is the speed in km/hr?**
**Answer:** 18 km/hr[^1].
6. **A Jackal takes 4 leaps for every 5 of a goat, but 3 Jackal leaps = 4 goat leaps. Compare speeds.**
**Answer:** 16:15[^1].

## **7. Additional Tips and Tricks**

- **Always check units** before applying formulas.
- **For trains, boats, and races,** use relative speed.
- **For average speed,** use correct formula based on whether distance or time is constant.
- **For ratios,** remember speed and time are inversely proportional for the same distance.

## **8. Quick Reference Table (Cheatsheet)**

| Formula / Rule | Use Case |
| :-- | :-- |
| \$ S = D/T \$ | Basic calculation |
| \$ D = S \times T \$ | Find distance |
| \$ T = D/S \$ | Find time |
| \$ 1 km/hr = 5/18 m/s \$ | Unit conversion |
| \$ 1 m/s = 18/5 km/hr \$ | Unit conversion |
| \$ Average Speed = 2xy/(x+y) \$ | Equal distances at two speeds |
| \$ Average Speed = (x+y)/2 \$ | Equal time at two speeds |
| Relative speed (same direction) | \$ |
| Relative speed (opposite direction) | \$ x+y \$ |
| Ratio of speeds a:b, time is b:a | Inverse for same distance |

## **9. Summary**

- **Speed, time, and distance** are fundamentally linked: knowing any two lets you find the third.
- **Master unit conversions** and always check units before solving.
- **Practice** with a variety of problems: straight-line motion, trains, races, boats, etc.
- Use the **formulas and cheatsheet** above for quick revision.
