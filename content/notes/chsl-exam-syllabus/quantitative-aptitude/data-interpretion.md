Data Interpretation is about understanding and analyzing data given in tables, charts, or graphs to answer questions. Here’s a simple summary with emojis for each type!

---

### Key Tips for DI Success 📝

- **Read Carefully** 👀: Always read the full question and data set.
- **Analyze Data** 🧐: Don’t get overwhelmed—break it down.
- **Check Units** ⚖️: Watch for different units (e.g., km/h vs. seconds).
- **Approximate When Needed** 🔍: If options are far apart, round numbers for speed.
- **Use Last Digit Tricks** 🔢: Sometimes, just the last digit helps pick the answer.
- **Practice Mental Math** 🧠: The faster you calculate, the more time you save!

### Types of Data Interpretation 📈

- **Tabular DI** 📋
- **Pie Chart** 🥧
- **Bar Graph** 📊
- **Line Graph** 📉
- **Caselet DI** 📄

---

### Tabular DI 📋

Data is shown in a table (rows \& columns). Example:


| Year | Banyan | Neem | Teak |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 2013 | 30000 | 25000 | 15000 |
| 2014 | 35000 | 30000 | 5000 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Sample Questions:**

- **Ratio** ➗: Neem (2015) to Banyan (2014) = 45000:35000 = 9:7
- **Average** 🧮: Average Neem trees = (Sum of Neem trees over years) ÷ 6 = 40830 (approx)
- **Percentage Increase** 📈: Teak (2017 vs 2016) = [(35000-25000)/25000] × 100 = 40%

---

### Pie Chart 🥧

A circle split into sectors, each sector shows a part of the total.

**Key Formula:**

- Value of sector = (Angle/360°) × Total OR (Percentage/100) × Total

**Sample Questions:**

- **Difference** ➖: Students liking Analogue Electronics vs VLSI = 240 – 180 = 60
- **Total** ➕: Students liking 3 subjects = 240 + 180 + 180 = 600
- **Percentage Less** 📉: VLSI vs Analogue = (60/240) × 100 = 25%

---

### Bar Graph 📊

Bars show quantities for different categories.

**Sample Questions:**

- **Ratio** ➗: Newspaper P (A \& C) to Q (B \& D) = 1120:1280 = 7:8
- **Percentage Less** 📉: P (B, D, E) vs Q (A, C, D, E) = [(2400 – 1860)/2400] × 100 = 22.5%

---

### Line Graph 📉

Lines show trends or changes over time.

**Sample Questions:**

- **Percentage Change** 📈: Red candies (2018 vs 2017) = (50 – 40)/50 × 100 = 20%
- **Difference** ➖: Candies (2017 \& 2018) vs (2014 \& 2015) = 145 – 125 = 20 lakhs
- **Average Comparison** 🧮: Blue candies ≥ average in 4 years (2013, 2014, 2016, 2017)
- **Total Difference** ➖: Red vs Blue candies (all years) = 190 – 180 = 10 lakhs
- **Ratio** ➗: Red (2013–15) to Blue (2016–18) = 80:85 = 16:17

---

### Caselet DI 📄

A paragraph describes the data. Read, extract info, and solve.

**Example:**

- 3 friends buy laptops (MRP ₹60,000 each). A pays ₹51,000, B pays ₹3,000 more, C pays average of A \& B.
    - **Total paid:** 51,000 + 54,000 + 52,500 = ₹157,500
    - **Total MRP:** 60,000 × 3 = ₹180,000
    - **Ratio paid to MRP:** 157,500:180,000 = 7:8

## **1. Tabular Data Interpretation**

**Definition:** Data is presented in tables with rows and columns. Questions require analysis and calculation based on the table.

### **Example Table**

| Year | Banyan | Neem | Teak |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 2013 | 30000 | 25000 | 15000 |
| 2014 | 35000 | 30000 | 5000 |
| 2015 | 35000 | 45000 | 10000 |
| 2016 | 40000 | 40000 | 25000 |
| 2017 | 45000 | 55000 | 35000 |
| 2018 | 55000 | 50000 | 40000 |

#### **Sample Questions and Solutions**

**Q1.** What is the ratio of Neem trees planted in 2015 to Banyan trees planted in 2014?

- Neem (2015): 45,000
- Banyan (2014): 35,000
- **Ratio:** \$ \frac{45,000}{35,000} = \frac{9}{7} \$

---

**Q2.** What is the average number of Neem trees planted over all years?

- Neem Total: 25,000 + 30,000 + 45,000 + 40,000 + 55,000 + 50,000 = 245,000
- Number of Years: 6
- **Average:** \$ \frac{245,000}{6} \approx 40,833 \$

---

**Q3.** By what percent did the number of Teak trees planted increase from 2016 to 2017?

- Teak (2016): 25,000; Teak (2017): 35,000
- Increase: 10,000
- **Percent Increase:** \$ \frac{10,000}{25,000} \times 100 = 40\% \$

---

### **Practice Questions**

1. What is the total number of Banyan trees planted from 2013 to 2018?
2. Find the year with the highest total number of trees planted (sum all three types each year).
3. In which year was the difference between Neem and Teak trees planted the greatest?

**Answers:**

1. 30,000 + 35,000 + 35,000 + 40,000 + 45,000 + 55,000 = **240,000**
2. Calculate totals for each year; the year with the highest sum is **2018**.
3. Compare Neem–Teak for each year; the greatest difference is in **2015** (45,000–10,000=35,000).

---

## **2. Pie Chart Data Interpretation**

**Definition:** A pie chart divides a circle (360° or 100%) into sectors representing data proportions.

### **Key Formulas**

- **Value from Angle:** \$ Value = \frac{Angle}{360^\circ} \times Total \$
- **Value from Percent:** \$ Value = \frac{Percent}{100} \times Total \$

---

### **Example**

Suppose 1,000 students like five engineering subjects:


| Subject | Percent |
| :-- | :-- |
| Analogue Electronics | 24% |
| VLSI Design | 18% |
| Wireless Communication | 18% |
| (others omitted) |  |


---

#### **Sample Questions and Solutions**

**Q1.** How many students like Analogue Electronics and VLSI Design?

- Analogue: \$ \frac{24}{100} \times 1,000 = 240 \$
- VLSI: \$ \frac{18}{100} \times 1,000 = 180 \$
- **Total:** 240 + 180 = **420**

---

**Q2.** VLSI Design students are what percent less than Analogue Electronics?

- Difference: 240 – 180 = 60
- **Percent less:** \$ \frac{60}{240} \times 100 = 25\% \$

---

### **Practice Questions**

1. If 20% like Digital Signal Processing, how many students is that?
2. What is the ratio of students liking Analogue Electronics to Wireless Communication?

**Answers:**

1. \$ \frac{20}{100} \times 1,000 = 200 \$
2. Both are 240:180 = **4:3**

---

## **3. Bar Graph Data Interpretation**

**Definition:** Bar graphs use bars to represent quantities. Compare heights/lengths for analysis.

---

### **Sample Question and Solution**

Suppose daily newspaper sales (in units):


| City | Newspaper P | Newspaper Q |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| A | 640 | 450 |
| B | 560 | 600 |
| C | 480 | 650 |
| D | 750 | 680 |
| E | 550 | 620 |

**Q1.** Ratio of total sales of P in cities A and C to Q in B and D?

- P (A+C): 640 + 480 = 1,120
- Q (B+D): 600 + 680 = 1,280
- **Ratio:** \$ \frac{1,120}{1,280} = \frac{7}{8} \$

---

### **Practice Questions**

1. What is the total sales of Newspaper Q in all cities?
2. Which city has the highest combined sales of P and Q?

**Answers:**

1. 450 + 600 + 650 + 680 + 620 = **3,000**
2. Add P+Q for each city; the highest is **D** (750+680=1,430).

---

## **4. Line Graph Data Interpretation**

**Definition:** Line graphs show trends over time or categories with points connected by lines.

---

### **Example**

Suppose red and blue candies produced (in lakhs) over 6 years:


| Year | Red | Blue |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 2013 | 20 | 30 |
| 2014 | 25 | 40 |
| 2015 | 35 | 25 |
| 2016 | 20 | 30 |
| 2017 | 50 | 35 |
| 2018 | 40 | 20 |


---

#### **Sample Questions and Solutions**

**Q1.** Red candies in 2018 are what percent less than 2017?

- 2017: 50, 2018: 40
- Decrease: 10
- **Percent less:** \$ \frac{10}{50} \times 100 = 20\% \$

---

**Q2.** Total candies (red+blue) in 2014 and 2015 vs. 2017 and 2018?

- 2014+2015: (25+40)+(35+25)=65+60=125
- 2017+2018: (50+35)+(40+20)=85+60=145
- **Difference:** 145 – 125 = **20 lakhs more**

---

### **Practice Questions**

1. What is the average number of blue candies produced over 6 years?
2. In how many years was blue candy production ≥ average?

**Answers:**

1. (30+40+25+30+35+20)/6 = 180/6 = **30 lakhs**
2. Years: 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017 (**4 years**)

---

## **5. Caselet Data Interpretation**

**Definition:** Data is presented as a paragraph. Extract and organize information before solving.

---

### **Example**

Three friends A, B, C buy laptops (MRP Rs. 60,000 each).

- A pays Rs. 51,000
- B pays Rs. 3,000 more than A
- C pays the average of amounts paid by A and B

---

#### **Sample Questions and Solutions**

**Q1.** What is the ratio of total amount paid by A, B, C to the sum of MRP of all laptops?

- Amounts paid: A = 51,000; B = 54,000; C = (51,000+54,000)/2 = 52,500
- Total paid: 51,000 + 54,000 + 52,500 = 157,500
- Total MRP: 60,000 × 3 = 180,000
- **Ratio:** \$ \frac{157,500}{180,000} = \frac{7}{8} \$

---

### **Practice Questions**

1. What is the total discount received by all three friends?
2. What is the average amount paid per person?

**Answers:**

1. Total discount = Total MRP – Total paid = 180,000 – 157,500 = **22,500**
2. 157,500 / 3 = **52,500**
