Certainly! Below is a detailed explanation of the key topics in the **IIT Madras BS Descriptive Statistics** PDF, presented with examples, questions, and step-by-step solutions in a clear and structured layout[1].

---

## 1. Introduction to Statistics

**Statistics** is the science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data.

### Key Concepts

- **Population:** All elements of interest (e.g., all houses in Tamil Nadu).
- **Sample:** A subset of the population (e.g., 1000 houses from Tamil Nadu).
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Summarizing and describing data.
- **Inferential Statistics:** Drawing conclusions about a population from sample data.

**Example:**  
A teacher wants to know the average marks of all students in a school. She collects a sample of students and calculates their average. If she uses this to estimate the school average, she is using inferential statistics.

## 2. Data Types and Organization

### 2.1 Unstructured vs. Structured Data

- **Unstructured Data:** Not organized (e.g., social media posts).
- **Structured Data:** Organized (e.g., a table of student records).

**Example Table:**

| Name   | Gender | Date of Birth | Marks | Board     |
|--------|--------|---------------|-------|-----------|
| Anjali | F      | 17 Feb, 2003  | 484   | State     |
| Pradeep| M      | 3 June, 2002  | 514   | ICSE      |

### 2.2 Classification of Data

- **Categorical Data:** Labels (e.g., Gender, Board).
- **Numerical Data:** Numbers (e.g., Marks).

**Scales of Measurement:**
- **Nominal:** Categories (e.g., Gender).
- **Ordinal:** Ordered categories (e.g., ratings: poor, good, excellent).
- **Interval:** Numerical, no true zero (e.g., temperature in °C).
- **Ratio:** Numerical, true zero (e.g., height, weight).

---

## 3. Describing Categorical Data

### 3.1 Frequency Distribution

Counts of each category.

**Example:**  
Data: A, A, B, C, A, D, A, B, D, C

| Category | Frequency |
|----------|-----------|
| A        | 4         |
| B        | 2         |
| C        | 2         |
| D        | 2         |

### 3.2 Relative Frequency

Frequency divided by total observations.

| Category | Frequency | Relative Frequency |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| A        | 4         | 0.4               |
| B        | 2         | 0.2               |
| C        | 2         | 0.2               |
| D        | 2         | 0.2               |

### 3.3 Charts

- **Pie Chart:** Shows proportions.
- **Bar Chart:** Shows counts.
- **Pareto Chart:** Bar chart sorted by frequency.

**Pie Chart Example:**  
A: 40%, B: 20%, C: 20%, D: 20%

## 4. Describing Numerical Data

### 4.1 Types of Variables

- **Discrete:** Countable (e.g., number of people).
- **Continuous:** Measurable (e.g., height, weight).

### 4.2 Organizing Data

- **Frequency Table:** For discrete data.
- **Class Intervals:** For continuous data.

**Example:**  
Marks obtained by 50 students:

| Class Interval | Frequency |
|----------------|-----------|
| 30-40          | 3         |
| 40-50          | 6         |
| 50-60          | 18        |
| 60-70          | 17        |
| 70-80          | 4         |
| 80-90          | 2         |

### 4.3 Stem-and-Leaf Diagram

Shows individual data points.

**Example:**  
Ages: 15, 22, 29, 36, 31, 23, 45, 10, 25, 28, 48

| Stem | Leaf     |
|------|----------|
| 1    | 0 5      |
| 2    | 2 3 5 8 9|
| 3    | 1 6      |
| 4    | 5 8      |

---

## 5. Measures of Central Tendency and Dispersion

### 5.1 Mean

Sum of values divided by number of values.

**Example:**  
Data: 2, 12, 5, 7, 6, 7, 3  
Mean = (2+12+5+7+6+7+3)/7 = 6

### 5.2 Median

Middle value in ordered data.

**Example:**  
Ordered data: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 7, 12  
Median = 6 (4th value)

### 5.3 Mode

Most frequent value.

**Example:**  
Data: 2, 12, 5, 7, 6, 7, 3  
Mode = 7 (appears twice)

### 5.4 Range

Difference between maximum and minimum.

**Example:**  
Data: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5  
Range = 5 - 1 = 4

### 5.5 Variance and Standard Deviation

Measure of spread.

**Example:**  
Data: 68, 79, 38, 68, 35, 70, 61, 47, 58, 66  
Mean = (68+79+38+68+35+70+61+47+58+66)/10 = 59

Variance = Σ(xi - mean)² / n = 1898 / 10 = 189.8  
Standard Deviation = √189.8 ≈ 13.78

---

## 6. Percentiles and Quartiles

### 6.1 Percentiles

Value below which a given percentage of data falls.

**Example:**  
Data: 35, 38, 47, 58, 61, 66, 68, 68, 70, 79  
25th percentile:  
n = 10, p = 0.25  
np = 2.5 → 3rd value = 47

### 6.2 Quartiles

- **Q1:** 25th percentile
- **Q2:** 50th percentile (median)
- **Q3:** 75th percentile

**Example:**  
From above, Q1 = 47, Q2 = (61+66)/2 = 63.5, Q3 = 68

---

## 7. Association Between Variables

### 7.1 Categorical Variables

- **Contingency Table:** Shows counts for combinations of categories.
- **Stacked Bar Chart:** Shows counts for each category.

**Example:**  
Gender vs. Smartphone Ownership

| Gender | No | Yes | Total |
|--------|----|-----|-------|
| Female | 10 | 34  | 44    |
| Male   | 14 | 42  | 56    |

---

## 8. Numerical Variables

### 8.1 Scatter Plot

Shows relationship between two numerical variables.

**Example:**  
Age vs. Height

| Age (years) | Height (cm) |
|-------------|-------------|
| 1           | 75          |
| 2           | 85          |
| 3           | 94          |
| 4           | 101         |
| 5           | 108         |

---

## 9. Counting Principles

### 9.1 Addition Rule

If you can do A in n₁ ways or B in n₂ ways, total = n₁ + n₂.

**Example:**  
Choose a shirt (4 options) or a pant (3 options) → 4 + 3 = 7 ways

### 9.2 Multiplication Rule

If you can do A and B, total = n₁ × n₂.

**Example:**  
Choose a shirt and a pant → 4 × 3 = 12 ways

---

## 10. Factorial, Permutation, and Combination

### 10.1 Factorial

n! = n × (n-1) × ... × 1

**Example:**  
5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120

### 10.2 Permutation

Arrangement of r objects from n:  
nPr = n! / (n-r)!

**Example:**  
Arrange 3 books from 5: 5P3 = 60

### 10.3 Combination

Selection of r objects from n:  
nCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!)

**Example:**  
Choose 2 students from 4: 4C2 = 6

---

## 11. Example Questions and Solutions

### Q1: Find the mean, median, and mode of: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80

**Solution:**  
- **Mean:** (10+20+30+40+50+60+70+80)/8 = 45
- **Median:** (40+50)/2 = 45
- **Mode:** No mode (all unique)

---

### Q2: A class has 60 students. In how many ways can a captain and vice-captain be chosen?

**Solution:**  
Order matters → Permutation  
60P2 = 60 × 59 = 3540

---

### Q3: From a pack of 52 cards, how many ways to choose 4 cards of the same suit?

**Solution:**  
- **Choose suit:** 4C1 = 4
- **Choose 4 cards from suit:** 13C4 = 715
- **Total:** 4 × 715 = 2860

---

### Q4: If nC2 = nC3, find n.

**Solution:**  
nC2 = nC3  
n! / (2!(n-2)!) = n! / (3!(n-3)!)  
(n-2)(n-3) = 6  
n² - 5n + 6 = 6  
n² - 5n = 0  
n(n-5) = 0  
n = 0 or 5  
**Valid answer:** n = 5
