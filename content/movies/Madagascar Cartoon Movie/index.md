- Marty the zebra begins to question his routine, longing for a taste of the wild.
- With help from the zoo's resident penguins, Marty escapes.
- Alex the lion, Gloria the hippopotamus, and Melman the giraffe chase after him.
- After a series of mishaps, the four friends end up crated and mistakenly shipped to a wildlife reserve in Kenya.
- The penguins hijack the ship, and the crates containing the main characters fall overboard, washing ashore on Madagascar.
- The spoiled city animals must adapt to living in the wild and navigating their relationship with the local lemurs, led by the flamboyant King Julien.
