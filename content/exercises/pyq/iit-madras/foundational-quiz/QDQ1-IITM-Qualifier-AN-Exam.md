**8. Short Answer Question**
In a college of 500 students, 285 took Mathematics, 195 took Statistics, 115 took English, 70 took Mathematics and Statistics, 45 took Mathematics and English, 50 took Statistics and English, and 10 took all three courses. What is the total number of students who took none of these three subjects?
**Solution:**
Let \$ n(M) = 285 \$, \$ n(S) = 195 \$, \$ n(E) = 115 \$, \$ n(M \cap S) = 70 \$, \$ n(M \cap E) = 45 \$, \$ n(S \cap E) = 50 \$, \$ n(M \cap S \cap E) = 10 \$.
Number who took at least one =
\$ 285 + 195 + 115 - 70 - 45 - 50 + 10 = 285 + 195 + 115 = 595; 595 - 70 - 45 - 50 = 595 - 165 = 430; 430 + 10 = 440 \$
So, number who took none = \$ 500 - 440 = \$ **60**[^1].
