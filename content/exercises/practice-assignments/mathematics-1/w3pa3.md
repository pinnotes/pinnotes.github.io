## 1. Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ)

**1. What will be the equation of the tangent to the curve \$ f(x) = 2x^2 + 9x + 20 \$ at point $(-3, 11)$?**

**Options:**

- \$ y = 3x \$
- \$ y = -3x + 2 \$
- \$ y = -3x + 20 \$
- \$ y = -\frac{x}{3} + 2 \$
- \$ y = \frac{x}{3} + 20 \$
- \$ y = -\frac{x}{3} \$

**Solution:**
Slope at \$ x = -3 \$: \$ m = 2 \times 2 \times (-3) + 9 = -3 \$
Equation of tangent: \$ y = -3x + c \$
Passes through $(-3, 11)$: \$ 11 = -3 \times (-3) + c \implies c = 2 \$
**Answer:** \$ y = -3x + 2 \$[^1][^3][^4]

**2. Find the length of the line segment on the straight line \$ y = 2 \$ bounded by the curve \$ y = 4x^2 \$.**

**Options:**

- \$ \sqrt{2} \$
- \$ 1 + \sqrt{2} \$
- \$ 1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \$

**Solution:**
Intersection points: \$ 4x^2 = 2 \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \$
Length: \$ \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) \right| = \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2} \$

**3. Mr. Mehta has two sons. Both sons send money to their father each month separately as \$ M_1(x) = (x-2)^2 \$ and \$ M_2(x) = (x+2)^2 \$. If \$ x \$ denotes the month, then choose the curve which best represents the total amount \$ P(x) \$ received by Mr. Mehta every month.**

**Solution:**

**4. A civil engineer found that the durability \$ d \$ of the road she is laying depends on two functions \$ y_1 \$ and \$ y_2 \$ as follows: \$ d = a y_1 y_2 \$ where \$ a > 0 \$. Functions \$ y_1 \$ and \$ y_2 \$ depend on the amount of plastic (\$ x \$) mixed in bitumen, and their variations are shown in the graph given below. Find the values of functions \$ y_1 \$ and \$ y_2 \$ such that the durability of the road is maximum.**

**Solution:**
From graph: \$ y_1 = 6 - x \$, \$ y_2 = x + 1 \$
\$ d = a(6-x)(x+1) = -a x^2 + 5a x + 6a \$
Maximum at \$ x = \frac{5}{2} \$:
\$ y_1 = 6 - \frac{5}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \$, \$ y_2 = \frac{5}{2} + 1 = \frac{7}{2} \$[^1]

\$ A \$ is infinite.
\$ Y \$-coordinates: $(-25, 25)$
\$ X \$-coordinates: $(-5, 5)$
**Correct option:** \$ Y \$-coordinates of the points in set \$ A \$ belong to the interval $(-25, 25)$[^1][^2]

## 5. Contextual Questions

**Vaishali wants to set up a small plate making machine in her village. The table shows the different costs involved in making the plates. The demand (number of packets of the plate) versus selling price of plate per packet (in ₹) per day is shown in the figure.**


| Cost type | Cost (₹) per packet |
| :-- | :-- |
| Electricity | 1.5 |
| Miscellaneous | 6.5 |
| Raw material | 10 |

**Demand vs Selling price:**
From figure, demand \$ y = -2x + 120 \$

**Profit:**
Profit = Demand × (Selling price – Cost price) = $(-2x + 120)(x - 18)$

- **19. Which of the following expressions represents the profit per day?**
    - \$ 2(60 - x) \$
    - \$ (x - 18) \$
    - \$ 2(x - 18)(60 - x) \$
    - \$ (x + 18)(60 - x) \$
    - Inadequate information.

**Solution:**
Profit = \$ (-2x + 120)(x - 18) = 2(x - 18)(60 - x) \$
**Answer:** \$ 2(x - 18)(60 - x) \$[^1]

---

- **20. Vaishali should sell a packet with a minimum price of ₹___ so as not to incur any loss.**

**Solution:**

**Answer:** ₹18

---

- **21. To make maximum profit per day, the selling price per packet should be ₹___ (if not restricted by market).**

**Solution:**
Maximum profit at \$ x = 39 \$
**Answer:** ₹39

---

- **22. What should be the price of plate per packet (₹) to make a profit of ₹490 per day?**

Sum: \$ \frac{4n + 3}{5m + 5} = 3 \implies 4n + 3 = 15m + 15 \$
Product: \$ \frac{10}{5m + 5} = 2 \implies 10 = 10m + 10 \implies m = 0 \$
Then, \$ 4n + 3 = 15 \implies n = 3 \$
**Answer:** \$ m + n = 3 \$[^1]
