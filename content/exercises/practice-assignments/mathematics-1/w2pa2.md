## 1. Multiple Choice Question (MCQ)

**Question:**
If \$ R \$ is the set of all points which are 5 units away from the origin and are on the axes, then \$ R \$ is:

- \$ R = \{(5,5), (-5, 5), (-5, -5), (5, -5)\} \$
- \$ R = \{(5,0), (5, -5), (5, 5), (-5,0)\} \$
- \$ R = \{(5,0), (0,5), (5,5), (0, -5)\} \$
- \$ R = \{(5,0), (0,5), (-5,0), (0, -5)\} \$
- \$ R = \{(5,0), (0,5), (-5,0), (-5,5)\} \$
- There is no such set.

## 2. Multiple Choice Question (MCQ)

**Question:**
A point P divides the line segment MN such that MP : PN = 2 : 1. The coordinates of M and N are (-2, 2) and (1, -1) respectively. What will be the slope of the line passing through P and the point (1,1)?

- $\frac{4}{3}$
- 1
- Inadequate information.
- $-\frac{4}{3}$
- $\tan(\frac{3}{4})$
- None of the above

**Solution:**
Coordinates of P:
$x_p = \frac{2 \times 1 + 1 \times (-2)}{2 + 1} = 0$
$y_p = \frac{2 \times (-1) + 1 \times 2}{2 + 1} = 0$
So, P is $(0,0)$.
Slope of the line through P and (1,1):
$\frac{1-0}{1-0} = 1$
**Correct option:** 1

## 4. Multiple Choice Question (MCQ)

**Question:**
The student estimated the energy consumption in 2025 and created Table PS-2.2. Choose the correct option.


| Energy type | 1965 | 2015 | 2025 |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Oil (O) | 19000 | 49000 | o |
| Coal (C) | 17000 | 38000 | c |
| Gas (G) | 7000 | 29000 | g |

- **C:** \$ y = 17000 + \frac{38000-17000}{2015-1965} \times (2025-1965) = 42200 \$
- **G:** \$ y = 7000 + \frac{29000-7000}{2015-1965} \times (2025-1965) = 33400 \$
- **N:** \$ y = 2000 + \frac{6000-2000}{2015-1965} \times (2025-1965) = 6800 \$
- **R:** \$ y = 2000 + \frac{3000-2000}{2015-1965} \times (2025-1965) = 3200 \$

- R is a function because it has only one output for one input.
- If R is a function then it is a bijective function on X × Y, where X is the set of all values on the x axis, and Y is the set of all values on the y – axis.
- We can write R as R = {(a,b)|(a,b) ∈ X × Y,b = a + 2}, where X = {-2,-1,0,1,2} and Y = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.

## 10. Numerical Answer Type (NAT)

**Question:**
Leo rents a motorcycle for 2 days. The rental company provides the motorcycle at Rs. 500 per day with 100 km free per day. The additional charges after 100 km are Rs. 2 per km. Leo drives the motorcycle for a total of 500 km. How much (Rs.) will he have to pay to the rental company?

**Solution:**
Cost for 2 days: 2 × 500 = Rs. 1000
Free km: 2 × 100 = 200 km
Extra km: 500 - 200 = 300 km
Extra cost: 300 × 2 = Rs. 600
Total: 1000 + 600 = Rs. 1600

**Answer:** 1600

## 17. Multiple Select Question (MSQ)

**Question:**
Suppose there are two roads perpendicular to each other which are both at the same distance from Priya's house (considered as the origin). The meeting point of the two roads is on the x-axis and at a distance of 5 units from Priya's house. Choose the correct possible equations representing the roads.

- y = x + 5, y = -2x - 5
- y = -x – 5, y = x + 5
- y = 2x - 10, y = -2x - 10
- y = 2x – 5, y = -x - 5
- y = -x + 5, y = x – 5
- x = 5, x = -5

**Solution:**
Correct options:
y = x - 5, y = -x - 5 (if meeting point is at (5,0) or (-5,0), but in the PDF, the final answer is **y = -x + 5, y = x - 5** for (5,0), and **y = -x - 5, y = x + 5** for (-5,0). However, the correct form should be:
If the meeting point is at (5,0), the roads are y = x - 5 and y = -x + 5.
If at (-5,0), they are y = x + 5 and y = -x - 5.
**In the PDF, the options are not perfectly matched, but the closest are:**

- **y = -x + 5, y = x - 5**
- **y = -x - 5, y = x + 5**

**Correct options:**
y = -x + 5, y = x - 5
y = -x - 5, y = x + 5

## 20. Multiple Select Question (MSQ)

**Question:**
A woman is reported missing in a locality. The police department finds a human femur bone during their investigation. They estimate the height H of a female adult (in cm) using the relationship H = 1.8f + 70, where f is the length (in cm) of the femur bone. The length of the femur found is 35 cm, and the missing woman is known to be 130 cm tall. In the particular locality, maximum height of a female is 195 cm and the minimum length of a female femur bone is 15 cm. Based on the given data answer the following questions.

- If an error of 1 cm is allowed, bone could belong to missing female.
- If an error of 3 cm is allowed, bone could belong to missing female.
- If the height as a function of femur length is known to be accurate, the range of the function is .
- If the height as a function of femur length is known to be accurate, the range of the function is .
- If the height as a function of femur length is known to be accurate, the domain of the function is .

**Solution:**
Height for f=35: 1.8×35 + 70 = 133 cm
Error allowed: 3 cm (133-130=3), so bone could belong to missing female if error of 3 cm is allowed.
Range:  (minimum height: 1.8×15+70=97; maximum height: 195)
Domain: [15, (195-70)/1.8 = 69.44... but in the PDF, it says 625, which is likely a typo. However, according to the PDF, the answer is as follows:

**Correct options:**
If an error of 3 cm is allowed, bone could belong to missing female.
If the height as a function of femur length is known to be accurate, the range of the function is .
If the height as a function of femur length is known to be accurate, the domain of the function is . (Note: The domain value 625 is likely an error; the correct maximum f should be ≈ 69.44 for H=195.)

## 21. Multiple Choice Question (MCQ)

**Question:**

- m=2.5

**Solution:**
Minimum sum squared error is for m=2.

**Answer:** m=2
