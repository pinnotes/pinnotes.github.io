## Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ)

**Question 1:**
Choose the correct option.

- ○ f₃ is not a function.
- ○ f₆ is not a function.
- ○ f₅ is not a function.
- ○ All of the above are functions.

**Solution:**
Vertical line test fails only for f₆ and therefore f₆(x) is not a function.

---

**Question 2:**
Choose the correct option.

- ○ f₁ and f₃ are one-one functions in the given domain.
- ○ f₂ and f₄ are one-one functions in the given domain.
- ○ f₃ and f₅ are one-one functions in the given domain.
- ○ f₅ is one-one function in the given domain.

**Solution:**
The functions f₂ and f₄ are strictly decreasing functions in the domain [-4, 4], therefore these are one-to-one functions.

---

**Question 3:**
Choose the correct option.

- ○ f₁ and f₅ are strictly increasing functions in the given domain.
- ○ f₂ and f₄ are strictly decreasing functions in the given domain.
- ○ f₄ and f₅ are strictly decreasing functions in the given domain.
- ○ f₅ is strictly increasing function in the given domain.

**Solution:**
From the given graph, f₂ and f₄ are strictly decreasing functions in the domain [-4, 4].

## Questions 4 and 5 (Radioactive Decay Context)

**Question 4:**
Let N₀ be the number of atoms of a radioactive material at the initial stage (t = 0), and N(t) be the number of atoms at time t, given by N(t) = N₀e^{-λt}. If at time t₁, the number of atoms reduces to half of N₀, and at time t₂, the number of atoms reduces to one fourth of N₀, which equation is correct?

- ○ e^{t₁/t₂} = 2
- ○ e^{t₂/t₁} = 2
- ○ e^{t₂-t₁} = 2
- ○ e^{t₁-t₂} = 2

**Solution:**
e^{t₂-t₁} = 2

---

**Question 5:**
If N₁ is the number of atoms at time t = 1/λ, what is the ratio of N₀ to N₁?

- ○ 1 : e
- ○ e : 1
- ○ 1 : e^{-λ}
- ○ 1 : e^{λ}

**Solution:**
N₀ : N₁ = e : 1

## Multiple Select Questions (MSQ)

**Question 6:**
Selvi deposits ₹P in bank A at 10% per year for 10 years, then withdraws and deposits in bank B at 12.5% per year for n years. M_A(x) is the amount after x years in bank A, M_B(y) is the amount after y years in bank B. Choose the correct options.

- ☐ M_A(x) is a one-one function of x, for x ∈ (0,10)
- ☐ M_B(y) is a one-one function of y
- ☐ M_A(12) = P × 1.1^{12}
- ☐ M_A(12) = 0
- ☐ M_A(x) is strictly increasing in x, for x ∈ (0,10)
- ☐ M_B(y) is decreasing in y
- ☐ M_B(n) = (P × 1.1^{10}) × (1.125)^n
- ☐ M_B(n) = (P × 1.1^n) × (1.125)^{10}

**Solution:**
Correct options:

- M_A(x) is a one-one function of x, for x ∈ (0,10)
- M_B(y) is a one-one function of y
- M_A(12) = 0 (since withdrawn after 10 years)
- M_A(x) is strictly increasing in x, for x ∈ (0,10)
- M_B(n) = (P × 1.1^{10}) × (1.125)^n

**Question 7:**
There are two offers in a shop:

- First offer: discount of M(n)% if n products are bought
- Second offer: ₹1000 discount
Geeta shops for ₹15,000. f(n) and g(n) are total payable after first and second offers, respectively. T(n) is total payable after both offers.

Choose the correct options.

- ☐ f(n) = (100 – M(n)) × 15000 and g(n) = 14000
- ☐ f(n) = (100 – M(n)) × 1500 and g(n) = (100 – M(n)) × 15000 – 1000
- ☐ f(n) = (100 – M(n)) × 150 and g(n) = 14000
- ☐ T(n) = (100 – M(n)) × 15000 is the total payable when first offer is applied after the second
- ☐ T(n) = (100 – M(n)) × 140 is the total payable when first offer is applied after the second
- ☐ T(n) = (100 – M(n)) × 150 – 1000 is the total payable when second offer is applied after the first

**Solution:**
Correct options:

- f(n) = (100 – M(n)) × 150 and g(n) = 14000
- T(n) = (100 – M(n)) × 140 (when first offer is applied after the second)
- T(n) = (100 – M(n)) × 150 – 1000 (when second offer is applied after the first)

---

**Question 8:**
If M(n) = −n² + 18n − 72, n ∈ {6,7,8,9}, and Geeta can use offers in any sequence, choose the correct options.

- ☐ Total payable amount is same irrespective of the order in which the offers are applied.
- ☐ She should choose offer one and then offer two.
- ☐ She should choose offer two and then offer one.
- ☐ If she chooses offer one and then offer two, the minimum payable amount will be ₹12650.

**Solution:**
Correct options:

- She should choose offer one and then offer two.
- If she chooses offer one and then offer two, the minimum payable amount will be ₹12650.
