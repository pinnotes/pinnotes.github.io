**Question 14:**
A manufacturing company produces three types of products A, B, and C from one raw material in a single continuous process. This process generates total solid wastes (W) (in kg) as $W(r) = -0.0001r^3 + 0.1r^2 + r$, where $r$ is the amount of raw material used in kg. If instead, the company uses three different batch-processes (one batch process for one product) to produce the above products, then the amount of waste generated because of products A, B, and C are given as $W_A = -0.00001r^4 + 0.015r^3$, $W_B = -0.005r^3 + 0.05r^2$, and $W_C = 0.05r^2$ respectively.

What is the total amount of waste generated because of the three different batch-processes?

- ○ $-0.00001r^4 + 0.01r^3 + 1.5r^2$
- ○ $-0.00001r^4 + 0.015r^3 + 1.5r^2$
- ○ $-0.00001r^4 + 0.01r^3 + 0.1r^2$
- ○ $-0.00001r^4 + 0.01r^3 + 0.5r^2$
- ○ $-0.00001r^4 + r^3 + 1.5r^2$
- ○ $0.0001r^4 + 0.01r^3 + 1.5r^2$

**Solution:**
The total amount of waste generated is $-0.00001r^4 + 0.01r^3 + 0.1r^2$.

---

**Question 15:**
What is the ratio of the total waste generated by the three-batch-processes with respect to the single continuous process?

- ○ $-0.001r^2$
- ○ $-0.001r$
- ○ $-0.01r$
- ○ $-0.1r$
- ○ $0.1r$
- ○ $0.01r$

**Solution:**
The ratio is **0.1r** (Note: The solution in the PDF shows the ratio as $\frac{WA + WB + WC}{W(r)} = 0.1r$, but this is a simplification. The correct option is **0.1r** as per the options given.)

---

**Question 16:**
Let the company wastes Rs. 5,000 in waste treatment when it uses the single continuous process by consuming 100 kg of raw material. If instead of continuous process the company uses the three-batch-processes, then how much extra amount (in Rs.) will the company have to pay for waste treatment with respect to the continuous process?

- ○ 50,000
- ○ 500
- ○ 45,000
- ○ 5,000
- ○ 4,000

**Solution:**
The extra amount required is **45,000**.
