## Question ❓

🫵 You are tasked with implementing a series of functions that perform various operations on dictionaries in Python. These functions will manipulate dictionaries that represent fruit prices and perform different operations as specified.

`dictionary_operations(fruit_prices: dict, fruits: list)`

Perform a series of operations on the given fruit_prices dictionary based on the fruits list:

- 👉 Add fruits[0] with a cost of 3.
- 👉 Modify the cost of fruits[1] to 2.
- 👉 Increase the cost of fruits[2] by 2.
- 👉 Delete fruits[3] from fruit_prices.
- 👉 Print the price of fruits[4].
- 👉 Print the names of fruits in fruit_prices as a sorted list.
- 👉 Print the prices of fruits in fruit_prices as a sorted list.
- 👉 increase_prices(fruit_prices: dict) -> None

💹 Increase the prices of every fruit by 20% and round to two decimal places. Modify the dictionary in place.

`dict_from_string(string: str, key_type, value_type)`

🔁 Convert a string with comma-separated key-value pairs into a dictionary, converting the keys and values to the specified types.

`dict_to_string(D: dict) -> str`

🔁 Convert a dictionary back into a string with each key-value pair on a new line, using comprehensions.
