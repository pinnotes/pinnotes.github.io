## Question ‚ùì

# You are tasked with writing a program that can handle various tasks based on the input. The first line of the input represents the task to be performed. The possible tasks are:

# factors - Find the factors of a number n (including 1 and itself) in ascending order.

# find_min - Take n numbers from the input and print the minimum number.
# prime_check - Check whether a given number is prime or not.

# is_sorted - Check if all characters of the given string from input are in alphabetical order. Print the output as "True" or "False" accordingly.

# any_true - Take n numbers from input and check if any of the numbers are divisible by 3. Print the output as "True" or "False" accordingly.

# manhattan - Take inputs directions such as "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT" and "RIGHT" from the input until the input is "STOP". Assume you are starting from (0,0) in a cartesian coordinate. Find the Manhattan distance between the starting point and the ending point by following the steps in the cartesian plane.

# Write a program to solve these tasks. Use loops where necessary.


# Question Code

# this is to ensure that you cannot use the built in any, all and min function for this exercise but you can use it in the OPPEs.
