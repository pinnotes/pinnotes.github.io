This tool calculates the shortest distance between two lines in 2D. Enter the coefficients for each line in the form `Ax + By + C = 0`.

### Example 1: Parallel Lines
Calculate the distance between `3x + 4y + 10 = 0` and `6x + 8y + 5 = 0`.
{{< home/distance_between_lines a1="3" b1="4" c1="10" a2="6" b2="8" c2="5" >}}
