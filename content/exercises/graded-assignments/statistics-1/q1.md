This shortcode allows you to solve a quadratic equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ by just entering the coefficients.

### Example 1: Two Real Roots
This solves the equation $x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0$.
{{< home/quad_eq a="1" b="-5" c="6" >}}

---

### Example 2: One Real Root
This solves the equation $y^2 + 2y + 1 = 0$.
{{< home/quad_eq a="1" b="2" c="1" var="y" >}}

---

### Example 3: Complex Roots
This solves the equation $x^2 + x + 1 = 0$.
{{< home/quad_eq a="1" b="1" c="1" >}}

This interactive tool uses pure JavaScript to find the vertex, focus, and directrix for any parabola in the form $y = ax^2 + bx + c$.

### Example 1: A simple parabola
Solve for the properties of $y = 0.5x^2 + 2x - 3$.
{{< home/parabola_solver a="0.5" b="2" c="-3" >}}

---

### Example 2: Another example
Solve for the properties of $y = -x^2 + 6x - 8$.
{{< home/parabola_solver a="-1" b="6" c="-8" >}}

This tool finds the unique parabola equation ($y = ax^2 + bx + c$) that passes through two given points and has a specific slope at the first point.

### Example 1: Finding a Simple Parabola
Let's find the equation for the parabola passing through (0, 1) and (2, 5) with a slope of 2 at x=0.
(The answer should be y = xÂ² + 2x + 1)
{{< home/parabola_from_points x1="0" y1="1" x2="2" y2="5" slope_at_x1="2" >}}

---

### Example 2: Another Case
Find the parabola passing through (1, 6) and (3, 2) with a slope of 5 at x=1.
{{< home/parabola_from_points x1="1" y1="6" x2="3" y2="2" slope_at_x1="5" >}}

### Your Own Points
Enter your own points and slope to find the equation.

This tool finds the unique cubic equation ($y = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$) that passes through two given points and has a specific slope at each of those points.

### Example 1: Finding a Simple Cubic
Find the equation for the cubic passing through (0, 1) and (2, 9) with slopes of 0 and 12 at those points.
(The answer should be y = xÂ³ + 1)
{{< home/cubic_from_points_slopes x1="0" y1="1" m1="0" x2="2" y2="9" m2="12" >}}

---

### Example 2: Another Case
Find the cubic passing through (-1, 0) and (1, 4) with slopes of 3 and 15 at those points.
{{< home/cubic_from_points_slopes x1="-1" y1="0" m1="3" x2="1" y2="4" m2="15" >}}
