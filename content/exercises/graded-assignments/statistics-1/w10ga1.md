## **1. Expectation of the Sum of Numbers on Cards**

**Question:**
There are $2^n$ numbered cards in a deck, among which ${}^n C_i$ cards bear the number $i$ ($i = 0,1,2,\ldots,n$). From the deck, $m$ cards are drawn with replacement. What is the expectation of the sum of their numbers? (Enter the answer correct to one decimal accuracy.)

**Answer:**

$$
\frac{m n}{2}
$$

**Solution:**
Let $X_j$ be the random variable representing the number on the $j^\text{th}$ card drawn.
The probability that $X_j = x$ is $\frac{{}^n C_x}{2^n}$.
The expectation for one draw is:

$$
E(X_j) = \sum_{x=0}^n x \cdot \frac{{}^n C_x}{2^n} = \frac{n}{2}
$$

For $m$ independent draws, the expected sum is:

$$
\sum_{j=1}^m E(X_j) = \frac{m n}{2}
$$

## **2. Expected Value of $Y$ (Random Walk and Sign Patterns)**

**Question:**
An unbiased die is thrown $n+2$ times. After each throw, a '+' is recorded for 2 or 5 and '-' is recorded for 1, 3, 4, or 6, forming an ordered sequence. To each except the first and last sign, a random variable $X_i$ ($i=1,2,\ldots,n$) is associated, which takes the value 1 if both neighboring signs differ from the one between them, and 0 otherwise. If $Y = a S + b$ where $S = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$, find the expected value of $Y$.

**Options:**
a. $\left(a \times \frac{2 n}{9}\right)+b$
b. $\left(a \times \frac{2 n}{9}\right)$
c. $\frac{2 n}{9}+b$
d. $\frac{2 n}{9}$

**Answer:**
a. $\left(a \times \frac{2 n}{9}\right)+b$

**Solution:**
The pattern for $X_i = 1$ is either '$+ - +$' or '$- + -$'.
Probability for each:

$$
P(X_i = 1) = \left(\frac{4}{6}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{2}{6} + \left(\frac{4}{6}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{2}{6}\right)^2 = \frac{2}{9}
$$

$$
E(S) = \sum_{i=1}^n E(X_i) = \frac{2n}{9}
$$

$$
E(Y) = a E(S) + b = a \cdot \frac{2n}{9} + b
$$

## **3. True Statements about $Y$**

**Question:**
Which of the following statement(s) is/are true about $Y$ as defined above?

a. $V(Y) = a^2 V(S) + b$
b. $V(Y) = a^2 V(S)$
c. $V(Y) \neq a^2 V(S)$
d. $E(Y) = a^2 E(S) + b$
e. $E(Y) = a E(S) + b$

**Answer:**
b, e

**Solution:**
By properties of expectation and variance:

$$
V(Y) = a^2 V(S)
$$

$$
E(Y) = a E(S) + b
$$

## **4. Expected Distance After $n$ Steps (Random Walk)**

**Question:**
Amandeep is in the middle of a bridge of infinite length. He takes a unit step to the right with probability $p$ and to the left with probability $1-p$. Assume movements are independent. What is the expected distance between the starting point and endpoint after $n$ steps?

**Options:**
a. $2p-1$
b. $n(2p-1)$
c. $1-2p$
d. $n(1-2p)$

**Answer:**
b. $n(2p-1)$

**Solution:**
Let $X_i = 1$ (right) with probability $p$, $-1$ (left) with probability $1-p$.

$$
E(X_i) = 1 \cdot p + (-1) \cdot (1-p) = 2p-1
$$

$$
E(S) = \sum_{i=1}^n E(X_i) = n(2p-1)
$$

---

## **5. Variance of Distance After $n$ Steps**

**Question:**
What is the variance of the distance between the starting point and endpoint after $n$ steps?

**Options:**
a. $4 n p (1-p)$
b. $4 p (1-p)$
c. $1$
d. $n^2 (2p-1)^2 -1$

**Answer:**
a. $4 n p (1-p)$

**Solution:**

$$
E(X_i^2) = 1^2 \cdot p + (-1)^2 \cdot (1-p) = 1
$$

$$
V(X_i) = E(X_i^2) - [E(X_i)]^2 = 1 - (2p-1)^2 = 4p(1-p)
$$

$$
V(S) = \sum_{i=1}^n V(X_i) = 4 n p (1-p)
$$

## **6. Expected Number of White Balls Drawn**

**Question:**
A box contains $a$ white and $b$ black balls. $c$ balls are drawn at random without replacement. Find the expected value of the number of white balls drawn. (Enter the answer correct to 2 decimal places.)

**Solution:**
The expected number of white balls drawn is:

$$
E(X) = c \cdot \frac{a}{a+b}
$$

For example, with $a=7$, $b=4$, $c=2$:

$$
E(X) = 2 \cdot \frac{7}{11} \approx 1.27
$$

## **7. Expected Number of Trials to Open a Door**

**Question:**
Rohit wants to open his door with 5 keys (out of which 1 will open the door) and tries the keys independently and at random. If unsuccessful keys are eliminated, find the expected number of trials required to open the door.

**Options:**
a. $1$
b. $9$
c. $3$
d. $2$

**Answer:**
c. $3$

**Solution:**
The probability of success at the $k^\text{th}$ trial is $\frac{1}{5}$ for all $k$ (as each permutation is equally likely).

$$
E(X) = \frac{1+2+3+4+5}{5} = 3
$$

## **8. Variance of $aX + bY$**

**Question:**
$X$ and $Y$ are independent random variables with means $m_1$ and $m_2$, and variances $v_1$ and $v_2$ respectively. Find the variance of $aX + bY$.

**Answer:**

$$
a^2 v_1 + b^2 v_2
$$

**Solution:**
Since $X$ and $Y$ are independent:

$$
V(aX + bY) = a^2 V(X) + b^2 V(Y) = a^2 v_1 + b^2 v_2
$$

## **9. $E(2X+1)^2$ for Given Distribution**

**Question:**
Let $X$ be a random variable with the following probability distribution:

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
X & a & b & c \\
\hline
P(X=x) & \frac{1}{d} & \frac{1}{e} & \frac{f}{g} \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

Calculate the value of $E(2X+1)^2$. (Enter the answer correct to 2 decimal places.)

**Solution:**

$$
E(X) = a \cdot \frac{1}{d} + b \cdot \frac{1}{e} + c \cdot \frac{f}{g}
$$

$$
E(X^2) = a^2 \cdot \frac{1}{d} + b^2 \cdot \frac{1}{e} + c^2 \cdot \frac{f}{g}
$$

$$
E(2X+1)^2 = 4E(X^2) + 4E(X) + 1
$$

## **10. Values of $a$ and $b$ for Standardized Random Variable**

**Question:**
Suppose $X$ is a random variable for which $E(X) = m$ and $\text{Var}(X) = v$. Find the positive values of $a$ and $b$ such that $Y = aX - b$ has expectation 0 and variance 1.

**Options:**
a. $\frac{-1}{\sqrt{v}}, \frac{-m}{\sqrt{v}}$
b. $\frac{1}{v}, \frac{m}{\sqrt{v}}$
c. $\frac{1}{\sqrt{v}}, \frac{m}{\sqrt{v}}$
d. $1, m$

**Answer:**
c. $\frac{1}{\sqrt{v}}, \frac{m}{\sqrt{v}}$

**Solution:**

$$
E(Y) = aE(X) - b = 0 \implies m a - b = 0 \implies b = m a
$$

$$
V(Y) = a^2 V(X) = 1 \implies a^2 v = 1 \implies a = \frac{1}{\sqrt{v}}
$$

$$
b = m \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{v}}
$$
