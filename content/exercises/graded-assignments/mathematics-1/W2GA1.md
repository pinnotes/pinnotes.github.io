### 1. **Incident and Reflected Ray through Points (with Figure M1W2Q6)**

**Question:**
A incident ray is passing through the point (2, 3) makes an angle α with horizontal. The ray gets reflected at point M and passes through the point (5, 2) as shown in figure below.
*Fig: M1W2Q6*
Choose the set of correct option(s).

- The equation of incident ray is −5x −3y + 19 = 0
- The equation of incident ray is 3x + 2y −12 = 0
- The equation of reflected ray is 5x −3y −19 = 0
- The equation of reflected ray is 2x + y −12 = 0

**Answer:** Option a and c

**Solution:**
Since the incident ray and reflected ray make the same angle α with the horizontal, we use the figure to set up the equations:

Let the incident ray pass through (2,3) and reflect at M, then pass through (5,2).

Let tan(α) = (3)/(x−2) = (2)/(5−x)

Solving:
15 − 3x = 2x − 4
x = 19/5

Equation of incident ray:
(y − 3) = −5/3 (x − 2)
⇒ −5x − 3y + 19 = 0

Equation of reflected ray:
(y − 2) = 5/3 (x − 5)
⇒ 5x − 3y − 19 = 0

### 2. **Area of Triangle Formed by Points Dividing Sides (with Figure)**

**Question:**
Consider a triangle △ABC, whose coordinates are A(−3, 3), B(1, 7), and C(2, −2). Let the point M divide the line AB in 1:3, the point N divide the line AC in 2:3, and the point O is the mid-point of BC.
Find out the area of triangle △MNO (in sq. unit).
{{< /border >}}

{{< border >}}
**Answer:** 4.5

**Solution:**
Using the section formula:

- M divides AB in 1:3
\$ x_1 = \frac{-3 \times 3 + 1 \times 1}{1+3} = -2 \$
\$ y_1 = \frac{3 \times 3 + 1 \times 7}{1+3} = 4 \$
- N divides AC in 2:3
\$ x_2 = \frac{-3 \times 3 + 2 \times 2}{2+3} = -1 \$
\$ y_2 = \frac{3 \times 3 + 2 \times (-2)}{2+3} = 1 \$
- O is the midpoint of BC
\$ x_3 = \frac{1+2}{2} = 1.5 \$
\$ y_3 = \frac{7+(-2)}{2} = 2.5 \$

Area formula:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} |x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2)|
$$

Plugging values:
Area = 4.5 sq. units

### 3. **Missile Trajectories and Intersection (with Figure M1W2Q2)**

#### 4. **Distance from Origin to Intersection Point**

**Question:**
A fighter jet Mig-21 flies at a height of 2800m from origin O(0,0). The air defense system S-400 is located at 400m from origin. The missile Brahmos is fired from Mig-21 towards the warship, following a straight line at 45° with the ground (clockwise). S-400 fires a missile Triumpf with slope 2 from its location. Let P be the intersection point of the two missile paths.
Find the distance between point P and origin O in meters.
{{< /border >}}

{{< border >}}
**Answer:** 2000

**Solution:**

- Brahmos path: \$ y = -x + 2800 \$ (from (0,2800), slope = tan(180°−45°) = −1)
- Triumpf path: \$ y = 2x - 800 \$ (from (400,0), slope = 2)

Intersection:
Set \$ -x + 2800 = 2x - 800 \Rightarrow x = 1200, y = 1600 \$

Distance to origin:

$$
\sqrt{(1200-0)^2 + (1600-0)^2} = 2000 \text{ meters}
$$

#### 5. **Speed Required for Missile Interception**

**Question:**
If the speed of Brahmos missile is \$ 96\sqrt{10} \$ m/sec, what should be the speed of Triumpf missile (in m/sec), so that it hits the Brahmos at point P?
{{< /border >}}

{{< border >}}
**Answer:** 320

**Solution:**
Let the time taken by both missiles to reach P be equal.

- Distance for Brahmos: \$ \sqrt{(1200-0)^2 + (1600-2800)^2} = 12\sqrt{2} \times 10^2 \$
- Distance for Triumpf: \$ \sqrt{(1200-400)^2 + (1600-0)^2} = \sqrt{320} \times 10^2 \$

Set up:

$$
\frac{12\sqrt{2} \times 10^2}{96\sqrt{10}} = \frac{\sqrt{320} \times 10^2}{\text{speed}}
$$

Solving gives speed = 320 m/sec

### 4. **Perimeter of Triangle Formed by Intersecting Lines**

**Question:**
Find the perimeter of the triangle formed by the intersections of the following 3 lines:
\$ L_1: 2x + 3y − 6 = 0 \$
\$ L_2: 3x + 2y + 6 = 0 \$
\$ L_3: 3x − 3y + 6 = 0 \$
{{< /border >}}

{{< border >}}
**Answer:** 17.25

**Solution:**
Find intersection points (vertices):

- \$ L_1 \$ and \$ L_2 \$: \$ M(-6, 6) \$
- \$ L_1 \$ and \$ L_3 \$: \$ N(0, 2) \$
- \$ L_2 \$ and \$ L_3 \$: \$ O(-2, 0) \$

Distances:

- \$ MN = \sqrt{(0+6)^2 + (2-6)^2} = \sqrt{52} \$
- \$ NO = \sqrt{(-2-0)^2 + (0-2)^2} = \sqrt{8} \$
- \$ MO = \sqrt{(-2+6)^2 + (0-6)^2} = \sqrt{52} \$

Perimeter: \$ \sqrt{52} + \sqrt{8} + \sqrt{52} = 17.25 \$

### 6. **Shortest Path from Town to Highway (with Map/Graph)**

**Question:**
A state government wants to connect a town to the national highway. Three possible locations in the town: A(3,8), B(5,7), C(6,9). The highway connects (2,1) and (10,7). Which point should be selected for the shortest path, and what is the minimum length required (in meters)?
*Hint: 1 unit = 100 meters*
{{< /border >}}

{{< border >}}
**Answer:**

- Point B
- Minimum length required: 300 meters

**Solution:**
Calculate perpendicular distances from each town location to the highway (line through (2,1) and (10,7)). The minimum is for point B, and the distance is 3 units = 300 meters.

### 7. **Collision of Bird and Aeroplane (with Path Lines)**

**Question:**
A bird is flying along the straight line \$ 2y - 6x = 20 \$. An aeroplane starts at the origin and passes through (4,12). Do the bird and plane collide? Enter 1 if yes, 0 if no.
{{< /border >}}

{{< border >}}
**Answer:** 0

**Solution:**
Plane's path: y = 3x (passes through (0,0) and (4,12)).
Bird's path: \$ 2y - 6x = 20 \$ ⇒ y = 3x + 10.
Both lines have the same slope but different intercepts, so they are parallel and never meet.

### 8. **Rock Thrown in Pond: Area of Ripple Circle (with Expanding Circle Visualization)**

**Question:**
A rock is thrown in a pond, creating circular ripples whose radius increases at 0.2 m/s. What is the value of \$ A/\pi \$, where A is the area of the circle after 10 seconds?
{{< /border >}}

{{< border >}}
**Answer:** 4

**Solution:**
After 10 seconds, radius r = 0.2 × 10 = 2 m
Area \$ = \pi r^2 \$ ⇒ \$ A/\pi = 2^2 = 4 \$
