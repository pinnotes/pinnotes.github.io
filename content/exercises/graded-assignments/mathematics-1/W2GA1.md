Based on the information from the sources, we can represent the paths of the bird and the aeroplane as straight lines in the coordinate plane. A point on this plane can be described by an ordered pair (x, y).

First, let's determine the equation of the straight line along which the bird is flying. The equation given is 2y - 6x = 6. We can simplify this equation. Dividing the entire equation by 2 gives us y - 3x = 3. Rearranging this into the slope-intercept form, which is generally written as y = mx + c, where m is the slope and c is the y-intercept, we get:
y = 3x + 3

Next, let's determine the equation of the straight line along which the aeroplane is flying. The aeroplane starts at the origin, which has coordinates (0,0), and passes through the point (4,12). We can find the equation of the line passing through these two points using the two-point form of a straight line. Given two points (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂), the equation is (y - y₁) = (y₂ - y₁) / (x₂ - x₁) * (x - x₁).
Let (x₁, y₁) = (0,0) and (x₂, y₂) = (4,12).
Substituting these values into the formula:
(y - 0) = (12 - 0) / (4 - 0) * (x - 0)
y = 12 / 4 * x
y = 3x

So, the equation of the line for the aeroplane's path is y = 3x.

To determine if the bird and the aeroplane collide, we need to find if their paths intersect. This means we need to find if there is a point (x, y) that lies on both lines simultaneously. We can do this by setting the y values of the two equations equal to each other:
Equation for bird's path: y = 3x + 3
Equation for aeroplane's path: y = 3x

Setting them equal:
3x + 3 = 3x

Subtracting 3x from both sides:
3 = 0

This result, 3 = 0, is a contradiction. A contradiction indicates that there is no solution to this system of equations, meaning the two lines do not intersect.

The slope of the bird's path (y = 3x + 3) is m₁ = 3. The slope of the aeroplane's path (y = 3x) is m₂ = 3. Since the slopes of the two lines are equal (m₁ = m₂ = 3), the lines are parallel. Parallel lines that are not identical do not intersect.

Therefore, because the paths of the bird and the aeroplane are represented by parallel lines that do not coincide, there is no point where they would collide.

The query asks for the answer to be 1 if they collide and 0 if not. Since they do not collide, the answer is 0.

Certainly. Let's calculate the requested value based on the information provided and the concepts from the sources.

The rock thrown in the pond creates circular ripples. The radius of these ripples increases at a rate of 0.2 meters per second. We are asked to find the value of A/π after 25 seconds, where A is the area of the circle.

The sources discuss geometric shapes in a coordinate plane, such as circles, which can be defined based on the distance from a central point (like the origin). The radius 'r' of the circular ripple can be thought of as this distance from the point where the rock entered the water (the origin).

The rate at which the radius increases is given as 0.2 meters per second. To find the radius after 25 seconds, we multiply the rate by the time:
Radius (r) after 25 seconds = Rate of increase × Time
r = 0.2 m/s × 25 s = 5 meters.

The formula for the area of a circle is given as A = πr².
Using the radius we calculated:
A = π × (5 meters)²
A = π × 25 square meters
A = 25π square meters.

Finally, we need to find the value of A/π:
A/π = (25π square meters) / π
A/π = 25.

Therefore, the value of A/π after 25 seconds is 25.

Certainly. Let's analyse the weight loss scenario described in your query, drawing upon the provided data and the concepts discussed in the sources.

The fitness trainer has provided an equation for his best client's weight loss: \\(W = -8t + 98\\), where \\(W\\) is the weight in Kg and \\(t\\) is the time in months.

You have also provided a table of data points for the client's weight over 6 months:
*   t=0, W=98
*   t=1, W=90
*   t=2, W=82
*   t=3, W=74
*   t=4, W=66
*   t=5, W=58
*   t=6, W=50

We can check if the given equation \\(W = -8t + 98\\) is correct by substituting the time values from the table into the equation and seeing if the calculated weight matches the recorded weight.
*   When \\(t = 0\\), \\(W = -8(0) + 98 = 98\\). This matches the data point (0, 98).
*   When \\(t = 1\\), \\(W = -8(1) + 98 = -8 + 98 = 90\\). This matches the data point (1, 90).
*   When \\(t = 2\\), \\(W = -8(2) + 98 = -16 + 98 = 82\\). This matches the data point (2, 82).
*   When \\(t = 3\\), \\(W = -8(3) + 98 = -24 + 98 = 74\\). This matches the data point (3, 74).
*   When \\(t = 4\\), \\(W = -8(4) + 98 = -32 + 98 = 66\\). This matches the data point (4, 66).
*   When \\(t = 5\\), \\(W = -8(5) + 98 = -40 + 98 = 58\\). This matches the data point (5, 58).
*   When \\(t = 6\\), \\(W = -8(6) + 98 = -48 + 98 = 50\\). This matches the data point (6, 50).

Since the equation \\(W = -8t + 98\\) holds true for all the given data points, we can confirm that **this equation accurately represents the client's weight loss progress** based on the provided data. The sources mention that a straight line can be uniquely identified by two points. Here, all seven points lie on this specific line, confirming its correctness for the given data.

The equation \\(W = -8t + 98\\) is in the form of a straight line equation, \\(y = mx + c\\). In this context, \\(W\\) is the dependent variable (like \\(y\\)), \\(t\\) is the independent variable (like \\(x\\)), \\(m\\) is the slope, and \\(c\\) is the y-intercept.
The slope of a line, \\(m\\), is defined as the change in the dependent variable (\\(\Delta y\\) or \\(\Delta W\\)) divided by the change in the independent variable (\\(\Delta x\\) or \\(\Delta t\\)). It represents the rate of change. In the equation \\(W = -8t + 98\\), the slope \\(m\\) is **-8**.

The slope of -8 indicates that for every one-month increase in time (\\(\Delta t = 1\\)), the weight decreases by 8 Kg (\\(\Delta W = -8\\)). Therefore, the rate of weight loss for the best client is **8 Kg per month**.

Now, you want to calculate how long it will take for you to lose weight from 100 kg to 72 kg, assuming your rate of weight loss is the same as the best client's rate (8 Kg per month).

The total weight you need to lose is:
Total weight loss = Starting weight - Target weight
Total weight loss = 100 Kg - 72 Kg = **28 Kg**.

Using the assumed constant rate of weight loss (8 Kg per month), we can find the time required:
Time (in months) = Total weight loss / Rate of weight loss
Time (in months) = 28 Kg / (8 Kg/month)
Time (in months) = **3.5 months**.

The question asks for the time in days, assuming 1 month has 30 days.
Time (in days) = Time (in months) × Days per month
Time (in days) = 3.5 months × 30 days/month
Time (in days) = **105 days**.

Therefore, assuming a constant rate of weight loss of 8 kg per month, it will take **105 days** for you to lose weight from 100 kg to 72 kg. The sources discuss how linear equations can be used to model real-world phenomena, such as the relationship between voltage and current in a physics experiment, which is analogous to modelling weight loss over time with a constant rate. The concept of fitting a straight line to data points and evaluating how well it fits, potentially using the sum squared error (SSE), is also relevant to validating the linear model provided.

Drawing on the information from the sources and our conversation history, we can determine the coordinates of the fourth vertex of a parallelogram.

The sources introduce the **rectangular coordinate system**, where a point in a plane is specified by an ordered pair \((x, y)\). This system is based on two perpendicular lines, the X-axis and the Y-axis, which intersect at the origin. Every point on this plane has a unique identification using coordinates.

The sources also cover the **distance between any two points** \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) in the Cartesian plane using the formula \(\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\), which is derived using the Pythagorean theorem.

Furthermore, the **section formula** is introduced and derived. This formula allows us to find the coordinates of a point \((x, y)\) that divides a line segment connecting two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) in a given ratio \(m:n\). The formula for a point P \((x, y)\) that internally cuts the line segment AB in the ratio m:n is given by \\[x = \frac{mx_2 + nx_1}{m+n}\\], and \\[y = \frac{my_2 + ny_1}{m+n}\\]..

As discussed in our previous conversation regarding this query, a crucial property of a parallelogram (which is not explicitly detailed in the provided source excerpts) is that its diagonals bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of the diagonal AC is the same as the midpoint of the diagonal BD.

The **midpoint** of a line segment is a special case of the section formula where the ratio \(m:n\) is 1:1. Using the section formula with \(m=1\) and \(n=1\), the coordinates of the midpoint of a segment connecting \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) are found to be \\[x = \frac{1 \cdot x_2 + 1 \cdot x_1}{1+1} = \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}\\] and \\[y = \frac{1 \cdot y_2 + 1 \cdot y_1}{1+1} = \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\]..

Let the coordinates of the fourth vertex D be \((x_D, y_D)\).
The midpoint of the diagonal AC with endpoints A\((x_1, y_1)\) and C\((x_3, y_3)\) is:
\(\left(\frac{x_1 + x_3}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_3}{2}\right)\)

The midpoint of the diagonal BD with endpoints B\((x_2, y_2)\) and D\((x_D, y_D)\) is:
\(\left(\frac{x_2 + x_D}{2}, \frac{y_2 + y_D}{2}\right)\)

Since the midpoints are the same, we can equate the corresponding coordinates:
\(\frac{x_1 + x_3}{2} = \frac{x_2 + x_D}{2}\)
Multiplying both sides by 2:
\(x_1 + x_3 = x_2 + x_D\)
Solving for \(x_D\):
\(x_D = x_1 + x_3 - x_2\)

Similarly, for the y-coordinates:
\(\frac{y_1 + y_3}{2} = \frac{y_2 + y_D}{2}\)
Multiplying both sides by 2:
\(y_1 + y_3 = y_2 + y_D\)
Solving for \(y_D\):
\(y_D = y_1 + y_3 - y_2\)

Thus, the coordinates of the fourth vertex D are \((x_1 + x_3 - x_2, y_1 + y_3 - y_2)\).

Comparing this result with the provided options:
*   \((x_1 + x_2 + x_3, y_1 + y_2 + y_3)\)
*   \((x_1 - x_2 + x_3, y_1 - y_2 + y_3)\)
*   \((x_1 + x_2 - x_3, y_1 + y_2 - y_3)\)
*   \((x_1 - x_2 - x_3, y_1 - y_2 - y_3)\)

The coordinates we derived, \((x_1 + x_3 - x_2, y_1 + y_3 - y_2)\), match the second option when the terms are reordered. Therefore, the coordinate of the fourth vertex D is always denoted by **\((x_1 - x_2 + x_3, y_1 - y_2 + y_3)\)**.

Based on the information from the sources and our conversation history, we can analyse the experimental data using the concept of Sum Squared Error (SSE) to determine which student's data provides a better fit.

The sources discuss the **Sum Squared Error (SSE)** as a method to evaluate how well a linear model fits a given set of data points. Specifically, for a line of fit \(y = mx + c\) and a set of \(n\) points \((x_i, y_i)\), the SSE is calculated as the sum of the squares of the deviations of the predicted values (\(mx_i + c\)) from the actual data values (\(y_i\)):
\\[ \text{SSE} = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - (mx_i + c))^2 \\]
The sources indicate that the **best fit** line is the one that minimizes the SSE. Consequently, when comparing different fits, a **lower SSE value indicates a better fit**, representing a smaller total squared difference between the observed data and the values predicted by the model.

The ideal gas equation \(Pv = RT\) can be viewed as a linear relationship between pressure \(P\) and temperature \(T\) when the molar volume \(v\) and the gas constant \(R\) are constant. Rearranging the equation gives \(P = \frac{R}{v} T\). This is in the form of a linear equation \(y = mx\), where \(P\) is the dependent variable (y), \(T\) is the independent variable (x), and the slope \(m\) is equal to \(\frac{R}{v}\). The sources discuss fitting experimental data, such as Ohm's law (\(V=IR\)), to a linear model \(y=mx\) where the resistance \(R\) (analogous to \(\frac{R}{v}\) here) is the slope to be determined. In this case, since \(P=0\) when \(T=0\), the line passes through the origin, meaning the y-intercept is 0, similar to the Ohm's law example.

We are given that \(v = 16.6\) m³/mol and the approximate value of \(R\) is reported as \(8.3\) J/(K·mol). This suggests that the model we are evaluating the data against is a linear relationship \(P = \frac{8.3}{16.6} T\), which simplifies to \(P = 0.5 T\).

To determine which student has a better fit, we need to calculate the SSE for each student's data using the model \(P = 0.5 T\). The data points are \((T_i, P_i)\). The SSE for each student is \(\sum (P_i - (0.5 \cdot T_i))^2\).

**For Student A:**
The data points are (200, 100), (250, 120), and (300, 150).
\\[ \text{SSE}_A = (100 - (0.5 \times 200))^2 + (120 - (0.5 \times 250))^2 + (150 - (0.5 \times 300))^2 \\]
\\[ \text{SSE}_A = (100 - 100)^2 + (120 - 125)^2 + (150 - 150)^2 \\]
\\[ \text{SSE}_A = (0)^2 + (-5)^2 + (0)^2 \\]
\\[ \text{SSE}_A = 0 + 25 + 0 = 25 \\]

**For Student B:**
The data points are (200, 105), (250, 128), and (300, 148).
\\[ \text{SSE}_B = (105 - (0.5 \times 200))^2 + (128 - (0.5 \times 250))^2 + (148 - (0.5 \times 300))^2 \\]
\\[ \text{SSE}_B = (105 - 100)^2 + (128 - 125)^2 + (148 - 150)^2 \\]
\\[ \text{SSE}_B = (5)^2 + (3)^2 + (-2)^2 \\]
\\[ \text{SSE}_B = 25 + 9 + 4 = 38 \\]

Comparing the calculated SSE values, we have \(\text{SSE}_A = 25\) and \(\text{SSE}_B = 38\). Since a lower SSE indicates a better fit, Student A's data (with SSE=25) has a better fit to the model \(P = 0.5T\) than Student B's data (with SSE=38).

Now let's consider the given options:
*   A has better fit than B.
*   B has better fit than A.
*   A and B both have same fit.
*   SSE calculated by B is 18.
*   SSE calculated by A is 14.
*   SSE calculated by both A and B is 18.

Our calculation shows that SSE calculated by A is 25 and SSE calculated by B is 38. This contradicts the options stating that SSE calculated by A is 14 or 18, and SSE calculated by B is 18. However, based on the principle of using SSE to determine the best fit, and comparing our calculated SSE values (25 vs 38), we find that **Student A has a better fit than Student B**. This matches the first option. While the numerical values of SSE provided in some options do not align with our calculation using the standard SSE formula and the derived model, the primary question asks about which student has a better fit, which is determined by comparing the SSE values.

Therefore, drawing upon the concept of SSE as a measure of fit from the sources, and calculating the SSE for each student's data relative to the implied model \(P = 0.5T\), we conclude that Student A's data fits the model better than Student B's data because SSE\_A < SSE\_B.

The correct option is:
**A has better fit than B.**

Certainly. To find the area of triangle △MNO, we first need to determine the coordinates of points M, N, and O using the given information and the relevant formulas from the sources.

The sources introduce the **rectangular coordinate system**, which allows us to specify the location of a point in a plane using an ordered pair \((x, y)\). This system is based on two perpendicular lines, the X-axis and Y-axis, that intersect at the origin. Every point on this plane has a unique identification using coordinates.

The **section formula** is presented for finding the coordinates of a point P\((x, y)\) that divides a line segment connecting two points A\((x_1, y_1)\) and B\((x_2, y_2)\) in a given ratio \(m:n\). For a point P that internally cuts the line segment AB in the ratio \(m:n\), the coordinates are given by \\[x = \frac{mx_2 + nx_1}{m+n}\\] and \\[y = \frac{my_2 + ny_1}{m+n}\\]. The derivation of this formula relies on constructing similar triangles and using the ratios of their corresponding sides. The **midpoint** of a line segment is a special case of the section formula where the ratio is 1:1. For points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\), the midpoint coordinates are \(\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right)\).

The sources also provide a formula for the **area of a triangle** formed by three non-collinear points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) in the XY plane. The area \(\triangle\) is given by \\[ \triangle = \frac{1}{2} |x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2)| \\]. The modulus (absolute value) sign is used to ensure that the area value is always positive. This formula can be derived by dropping perpendiculars from the vertices to the x-axis and calculating the areas of the resulting trapeziums.

Given the vertices of triangle ABC are A\((-3, 3)\), B\((1, 7)\), and C\((2, -2)\).

1.  **Find the coordinates of point M:**
    Point M divides the line segment AB in the ratio 1:3. Using the section formula with A\((x_1, y_1) = (-3, 3)\), B\((x_2, y_2) = (1, 7)\), \(m=1\), and \(n=3\):
    \\[ x_M = \frac{1 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot (-3)}{1 + 3} = \frac{1 - 9}{4} = \frac{-8}{4} = -2 \\]
    \\[ y_M = \frac{1 \cdot 7 + 3 \cdot 3}{1 + 3} = \frac{7 + 9}{4} = \frac{16}{4} = 4 \\]
    So, the coordinates of M are **(-2, 4)**.

2.  **Find the coordinates of point N:**
    Point N divides the line segment AC in the ratio 2:3. Using the section formula with A\((x_1, y_1) = (-3, 3)\), C\((x_2, y_2) = (2, -2)\), \(m=2\), and \(n=3\):
    \\[ x_N = \frac{2 \cdot 2 + 3 \cdot (-3)}{2 + 3} = \frac{4 - 9}{5} = \frac{-5}{5} = -1 \\]
    \\[ y_N = \frac{2 \cdot (-2) + 3 \cdot 3}{2 + 3} = \frac{-4 + 9}{5} = \frac{5}{5} = 1 \\]
    So, the coordinates of N are **(-1, 1)**.

3.  **Find the coordinates of point O:**
    Point O is the midpoint of the line segment BC. Using the midpoint formula with B\((x_1, y_1) = (1, 7)\) and C\((x_2, y_2) = (2, -2)\):
    \\[ x_O = \frac{1 + 2}{2} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \\]
    \\[ y_O = \frac{7 + (-2)}{2} = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \\]
    So, the coordinates of O are **(1.5, 2.5)**.

4.  **Find the area of triangle △MNO:**
    Using the area of a triangle formula with M\((x_1, y_1) = (-2, 4)\)$, N\((x_2, y_2) = (-1, 1)\)$, and O\((x_3, y_3) = (1.5, 2.5)\)$:
    \\[ \text{Area of } \triangle\text{MNO} = \frac{1}{2} |x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2)| \\]
    \\[ = \frac{1}{2} |(-2)(1 - 2.5) + (-1)(2.5 - 4) + (1.5)(4 - 1)| \\]
    \\[ = \frac{1}{2} |(-2)(-1.5) + (-1)(-1.5) + (1.5)(3)| \\]
    \\[ = \frac{1}{2} |3 + 1.5 + 4.5| \\]
    \\[ = \frac{1}{2} |9| \\]
    \\[ = \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \\]

Therefore, the area of triangle △MNO is **4.5 square units**.

Okay, let's determine the required speed of the Triumpf missile based on the information provided in the sources and your query.

The problem describes a scenario involving objects moving along straight line paths in a coordinate system. We need to use the concepts of coordinate geometry, distance, and speed to solve this. The sources discuss the **rectangular coordinate system** for locating points, the **distance between two points**, the **slope of a line**, and the **equation of a straight line**. We also need the relationship between distance, speed, and time, which is related to the idea of the rate of change.

Let's break down the problem into steps:

1.  **Determine the equation of the Brahmos missile's path.**
    The Mig-21 fires the Brahmos missile from a height of 2800m. The diagram shows the Brahmos missile's path passing through the origin O(0,0). The missile makes an angle of 45° measured clockwise with the ground (horizontal axis). A clockwise angle of 45° from the positive x-axis corresponds to an angle of -45°. The **slope** \(m\) of a line with an angle \(\theta\) with the positive x-axis is given by \(m = \tan \theta\). So, the slope of the Brahmos path is \(\tan(-45°) = -1\).
    Since the path is a **straight line** and passes through the origin (0,0) with a slope of -1, its equation, using the slope-intercept form \(y = mx + c\) where \(c=0\) for a line through the origin, is **\(y = -x\)**.
    The launch point of the Brahmos missile is at a height of 2800m and lies on this line. If the y-coordinate is 2800, then \(2800 = -x\), so \(x = -2800\). The launch point M is at **(-2800, 2800)**.

2.  **Determine the equation of the Triumpf missile's path.**
    The air defense system S-400 is located at a distance of 400m from the origin. The diagram shows it on the positive horizontal axis. So, the S-400 is at point S**(400, 0)**.
    The Triumpf missile follows a **straight line path** from S and has a slope of 2. Using the point-slope form of a straight line, \(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\), with \((x_1, y_1) = (400, 0)\) and \(m = 2\):
    \(y - 0 = 2(x - 400)\)
    The equation of the Triumpf path is **\(y = 2x - 800\)**.

3.  **Determine the coordinates of the intersection point P.**
    Point P is where the Triumpf missile hits the Brahmos missile, which is the intersection of their paths. We find the coordinates of P by solving the system of equations for the two lines:
    \(y = -x\)
    \(y = 2x - 800\)
    Set the y-values equal:
    \(-x = 2x - 800\)
    \(800 = 3x\)
    \(x_P = \frac{800}{3}\)
    Substitute \(x_P\) into the first equation to find \(y_P\):
    \(y_P = -\frac{800}{3}\)
    The intersection point P is **\(\left(\frac{800}{3}, -\frac{800}{3}\right)\)**.
    Note: While this point has a negative y-coordinate, suggesting it is below ground, we will proceed with this as the mathematically derived intersection point as per the problem description.

4.  **Calculate the distance travelled by the Brahmos missile to reach P.**
    The Brahmos missile travels from M(-2800, 2800) to P\(\left(\frac{800}{3}, -\frac{800}{3}\right)\). We use the **distance formula**:
    Distance MP = \(\sqrt{\left(\frac{800}{3} - (-2800)\right)^2 + \left(-\frac{800}{3} - 2800\right)^2}\)
    Distance MP = \(\sqrt{\left(\frac{800}{3} + \frac{8400}{3}\right)^2 + \left(-\frac{800}{3} - \frac{8400}{3}\right)^2}\)
    Distance MP = \(\sqrt{\left(\frac{9200}{3}\right)^2 + \left(-\frac{9200}{3}\right)^2}\)
    Distance MP = \(\sqrt{2 \times \left(\frac{9200}{3}\right)^2} = \frac{9200}{3} \sqrt{2}\) meters.

5.  **Calculate the time taken by the Brahmos missile to reach P.**
    The speed of the Brahmos missile is given as \(96\sqrt{10}\) m/sec.
    Time = Distance / Speed
    Time \(t_B = \frac{\text{Distance MP}}{\text{Speed of Brahmos}} = \frac{\frac{9200}{3} \sqrt{2}}{96 \sqrt{10}}\)
    Time \(t_B = \frac{9200 \sqrt{2}}{3 \times 96 \sqrt{10}} = \frac{9200}{288} \sqrt{\frac{2}{10}} = \frac{9200}{288} \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\)
    Simplifying the fraction \(\frac{9200}{288}\): \(\frac{9200}{288} = \frac{4600}{144} = \frac{2300}{72} = \frac{1150}{36} = \frac{575}{18}\).
    Time \(t_B = \frac{575}{18\sqrt{5}}\) seconds.

6.  **Calculate the distance travelled by the Triumpf missile to reach P.**
    The Triumpf missile travels from S(400, 0) to P\(\left(\frac{800}{3}, -\frac{800}{3}\right)\). We use the **distance formula**:
    Distance SP = \(\sqrt{\left(\frac{800}{3} - 400\right)^2 + \left(-\frac{800}{3} - 0\right)^2}\)
    Distance SP = \(\sqrt{\left(\frac{800}{3} - \frac{1200}{3}\right)^2 + \left(-\frac{800}{3}\right)^2}\)
    Distance SP = \(\sqrt{\left(-\frac{400}{3}\right)^2 + \left(-\frac{800}{3}\right)^2}\)
    Distance SP = \(\sqrt{\frac{160000}{9} + \frac{640000}{9}} = \sqrt{\frac{800000}{9}}\)
    Distance SP = \(\frac{\sqrt{800000}}{3} = \frac{\sqrt{160000 \times 5}}{3} = \frac{400\sqrt{5}}{3}\) meters.

7.  **Determine the required speed of the Triumpf missile.**
    For the Triumpf missile to hit the Brahmos missile at point P, both must arrive at P at the same time. Thus, the time taken by the Triumpf missile \(t_T\) must be equal to \(t_B\).
    Time \(t_T = t_B = \frac{575}{18\sqrt{5}}\) seconds.
    Speed of Triumpf = Distance SP / Time \(t_T\)
    Speed \(v_T = \frac{\frac{400\sqrt{5}}{3}}{\frac{575}{18\sqrt{5}}} = \frac{400\sqrt{5}}{3} \times \frac{18\sqrt{5}}{575}\)
    Speed \(v_T = \frac{400 \times 18 \times (\sqrt{5})^2}{3 \times 575} = \frac{400 \times 18 \times 5}{3 \times 575}\)
    Speed \(v_T = \frac{36000}{1725}\)
    Simplify the fraction: \(\frac{36000}{1725} = \frac{1440}{69} = \frac{480}{23}\).

The speed of the Triumpf missile should be **\(\frac{480}{23}\)** m/sec.

To find the perimeter of the triangle formed by the intersection of the three lines \(L_1\): \(2x + 3y - 6 = 0\), \(L_2\): \(3x + 2y + 6 = 0\), and \(L_3\): \(3x - 3y + 6 = 0\), we first need to determine the coordinates of the vertices of the triangle. The vertices are the points where pairs of these lines intersect. The sources introduce the **rectangular coordinate system** for specifying the location of points in a plane, and lines can be represented by equations in this system, such as the general form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). The intersection of two lines is a point that satisfies the equations of both lines.

**1. Finding the Intersection Points:**

Let the vertices of the triangle be A, B, and C, formed by the intersections of \(L_1\) and \(L_2\), \(L_1\) and \(L_3\), and \(L_2\) and \(L_3\), respectively.

*   **Intersection of \(L_1\) (\(2x + 3y - 6 = 0\)) and \(L_2\) (\(3x + 2y + 6 = 0\)):**
    We have the system of equations:
    1) \(2x + 3y = 6\)
    2) \(3x + 2y = -6\)
    Multiply equation (1) by 2 and equation (2) by 3 to eliminate \(y\):
    \(4x + 6y = 12\)
    \(9x + 6y = -18\)
    Subtracting the first new equation from the second:
    \((9x - 4x) + (6y - 6y) = -18 - 12\)
    \(5x = -30\)
    \(x = -6\)
    Substitute \(x = -6\) into equation (1):
    \(2(-6) + 3y = 6\)
    \(-12 + 3y = 6\)
    \(3y = 18\)
    \(y = 6\)
    So, the first vertex is **A(-6, 6)**.

*   **Intersection of \(L_1\) (\(2x + 3y - 6 = 0\)) and \(L_3\) (\(3x - 3y + 6 = 0\)):**
    We have the system of equations:
    3) \(2x + 3y = 6\)
    4) \(3x - 3y = -6\)
    Add equation (3) and equation (4) to eliminate \(y\):
    \((2x + 3x) + (3y - 3y) = 6 + (-6)\)
    \(5x = 0\)
    \(x = 0\)
    Substitute \(x = 0\) into equation (3):
    \(2(0) + 3y = 6\)
    \(3y = 6\)
    \(y = 2\)
    So, the second vertex is **B(0, 2)**.

*   **Intersection of \(L_2\) (\(3x + 2y + 6 = 0\)) and \(L_3\) (\(3x - 3y + 6 = 0\)):**
    We have the system of equations:
    5) \(3x + 2y = -6\)
    6) \(3x - 3y = -6\)
    Subtract equation (6) from equation (5) to eliminate \(x\):
    \((3x - 3x) + (2y - (-3y)) = -6 - (-6)\)
    \(0 + 5y = 0\)
    \(5y = 0\)
    \(y = 0\)
    Substitute \(y = 0\) into equation (5):
    \(3x + 2(0) = -6\)
    \(3x = -6\)
    \(x = -2\)
    So, the third vertex is **C(-2, 0)**.

The vertices of the triangle are A(-6, 6), B(0, 2), and C(-2, 0).

**2. Calculating the Length of Each Side:**

The sources provide the **distance formula** to find the distance between any two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) in the coordinate plane, which is \(\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\). This formula is based on the Pythagorean Theorem.

*   **Length of side AB:**
    Using points A(-6, 6) and B(0, 2):
    \(AB = \sqrt{(0 - (-6))^2 + (2 - 6)^2} = \sqrt{(6)^2 + (-4)^2} = \sqrt{36 + 16} = \sqrt{52}\)
    \(AB = \sqrt{4 \times 13} = 2\sqrt{13}\)

*   **Length of side BC:**
    Using points B(0, 2) and C(-2, 0):
    \(BC = \sqrt{(-2 - 0)^2 + (0 - 2)^2} = \sqrt{(-2)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 4} = \sqrt{8}\)
    \(BC = \sqrt{4 \times 2} = 2\sqrt{2}\)

*   **Length of side CA:**
    Using points C(-2, 0) and A(-6, 6):
    \(CA = \sqrt{(-6 - (-2))^2 + (6 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{(-4)^2 + (6)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 36} = \sqrt{52}\)
    \(CA = \sqrt{4 \times 13} = 2\sqrt{13}\)

**3. Calculating the Perimeter:**

The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides. This is a general geometric concept.

Perimeter = AB + BC + CA
Perimeter = \(2\sqrt{13} + 2\sqrt{2} + 2\sqrt{13}\)
**Perimeter = \(4\sqrt{13} + 2\sqrt{2}\)**

Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle formed by the intersections of the given three lines is **\(4\sqrt{13} + 2\sqrt{2}\)**.

To find the possible options for point P(t, t^2), we first need to calculate the areas of triangle ABC and triangle PAB using the given coordinates. We will then use the relationship between these areas provided in the problem.

The sources describe the **rectangular coordinate system** for locating points in a plane. The area of a triangle formed by three points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) in the coordinate plane can be calculated using the formula:
Area \( = \frac{1}{2} |x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2)|\).
The modulus is used because the area of any region is always positive.

**1. Calculate the Area of Triangle ABC**
The coordinates of the vertices of triangle ABC are A(4, 3), B(2, 2), and C(8, 3).
Let \((x_1, y_1) = A(4, 3)\), \((x_2, y_2) = B(2, 2)\), and \((x_3, y_3) = C(8, 3)\).
Using the area formula:
Area(ABC) = \(\frac{1}{2} |4(2 - 3) + 2(3 - 3) + 8(3 - 2)|\)
Area(ABC) = \(\frac{1}{2} |4(-1) + 2(0) + 8(1)|\)
Area(ABC) = \(\frac{1}{2} |-4 + 0 + 8|\)
Area(ABC) = \(\frac{1}{2} |4|\)
**Area(ABC) = 2 square units**.

**2. Calculate the Area of Triangle PAB**
The coordinates of the vertices of triangle PAB are P(t, t^2), A(4, 3), and B(2, 2).
Let \((x_1, y_1) = P(t, t^2)\), \((x_2, y_2) = A(4, 3)\), and \((x_3, y_3) = B(2, 2)\).
Using the area formula:
Area(PAB) = \(\frac{1}{2} |t(3 - 2) + 4(2 - t^2) + 2(t^2 - 3)|\)
Area(PAB) = \(\frac{1}{2} |t(1) + 8 - 4t^2 + 2t^2 - 6|\)
Area(PAB) = \(\frac{1}{2} |t + 2 - 2t^2|\)
**Area(PAB) = \(\frac{1}{2} |-2t^2 + t + 2|\) square units**.

**3. Use the Given Relationship to Find Possible Values of t**
The problem states that the area of triangle ABC is 4 times the area of triangle PAB.
Area(ABC) = 4 * Area(PAB)
\(2 = 4 \times \frac{1}{2} |-2t^2 + t + 2|\)
\(2 = 2 |-2t^2 + t + 2|\)
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\(1 = |-2t^2 + t + 2|\)

This equation implies two possibilities for the expression inside the absolute value:
Possibility 1: \(-2t^2 + t + 2 = 1\)
Rearranging into a standard quadratic form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\):
\(-2t^2 + t + 1 = 0\)
Multiplying by -1 to make the leading coefficient positive:
\(2t^2 - t - 1 = 0\)
Factoring the quadratic equation:
\((2t + 1)(t - 1) = 0\)
This gives two possible values for t:
\(2t + 1 = 0 \implies t = -\frac{1}{2}\)
\(t - 1 = 0 \implies t = 1\)

Possibility 2: \(-2t^2 + t + 2 = -1\)
Rearranging into a standard quadratic form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\):
\(-2t^2 + t + 3 = 0\)
Multiplying by -1 to make the leading coefficient positive:
\(2t^2 - t - 3 = 0\)
Factoring the quadratic equation:
\((2t - 3)(t + 1) = 0\)
This gives two additional possible values for t:
\(2t - 3 = 0 \implies t = \frac{3}{2}\)
\(t + 1 = 0 \implies t = -1\)

The possible values for t are \(-\frac{1}{2}\), \(1\), \(\frac{3}{2}\), and \(-1\).

**4. Determine the Coordinates of P(t, t^2) for Each Possible Value of t**
Since P has coordinates \((t, t^2)\), we substitute each value of t we found:
*   If \(t = -\frac{1}{2}\), then \(t^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}\). The point is \(\left(-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}\right)\).
*   If \(t = 1\), then \(t^2 = 1^2 = 1\). The point is \((1, 1)\).
*   If \(t = \frac{3}{2}\), then \(t^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{4}\). The point is \(\left(\frac{3}{2}, \frac{9}{4}\right)\).
*   If \(t = -1\), then \(t^2 = (-1)^2 = 1\). The point is \((-1, 1)\).

**5. Compare Calculated Points with the Given Options**
The possible coordinates for P are \(\left(-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}\right)\), \((1, 1)\), \(\left(\frac{3}{2}, \frac{9}{4}\right)\), and \((-1, 1)\).
We need to check which of these points are present in the list of options provided:
*   (0, 0) - Not in our list.
*   (2, 4) - Not in our list.
*   (-2, 4) - Not in our list.
*   (-1, 1) - **This point is in our list.**
*   (1, 1) - **This point is in our list.**

Therefore, the possible options for P from the given list are (-1, 1) and (1, 1).

The possible options for P are:
*   **(-1, 1)**
*   **(1, 1)**

Certainly. Let's determine the positive value of \(k\) based on the given information and the principles of coordinate geometry described in the sources.

We are given five points in the coordinate system: A(0, 3), B(\(x, y\)), C(4, 3), D(1, 0), and E(3, 1).

The problem provides two key pieces of information:
1.  Point B divides the line segment AC **internally** in the ratio \(k:1\).
2.  The area of triangle DEB is 2.

We will use the **section formula** and the **area of a triangle formula** to solve this problem.

**1. Find the Coordinates of Point B(\(x, y\))**
Since point B divides the line segment AC internally in the ratio \(k:1\), where A is \((x_1, y_1) = (0, 3)\) and C is \((x_2, y_2) = (4, 3)\), we can use the section formula for internal division with \(m=k\) and \(n=1\).
The coordinates of B(\(x, y\)) are:
\(x = \frac{m x_2 + n x_1}{m + n} = \frac{k(4) + 1(0)}{k + 1} = \frac{4k}{k + 1}\)
\(y = \frac{m y_2 + n y_1}{m + n} = \frac{k(3) + 1(3)}{k + 1} = \frac{3k + 3}{k + 1} = \frac{3(k + 1)}{k + 1} = 3\)
Thus, the coordinates of point B are \(\left(\frac{4k}{k + 1}, 3\right)\).

**2. Calculate the Area of Triangle DEB**
The vertices of triangle DEB are D(1, 0), E(3, 1), and B\(\left(\frac{4k}{k + 1}, 3\right)\). We can use the formula for the area of a triangle with vertices \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\), which is \(\frac{1}{2} |x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2)|\).
Let \((x_1, y_1) = D(1, 0)\), \((x_2, y_2) = E(3, 1)\), and \((x_3, y_3) = B\left(\frac{4k}{k + 1}, 3\right)\).
Area(DEB) = \(\frac{1}{2} \left| 1(1 - 3) + 3\left(3 - 0\right) + \frac{4k}{k + 1}\left(0 - 1\right) \right|\)
Area(DEB) = \(\frac{1}{2} \left| 1(-2) + 3(3) + \frac{4k}{k + 1}(-1) \right|\)
Area(DEB) = \(\frac{1}{2} \left| -2 + 9 - \frac{4k}{k + 1} \right|\)
Area(DEB) = \(\frac{1}{2} \left| 7 - \frac{4k}{k + 1} \right|\)
To simplify the expression inside the absolute value, we find a common denominator:
\(7 - \frac{4k}{k + 1} = \frac{7(k + 1) - 4k}{k + 1} = \frac{7k + 7 - 4k}{k + 1} = \frac{3k + 7}{k + 1}\)
So, Area(DEB) = \(\frac{1}{2} \left| \frac{3k + 7}{k + 1} \right|\). The modulus ensures the area is positive.

**3. Set the Area Equal to 2**
We are given that the area of triangle DEB is 2:
\(\frac{1}{2} \left| \frac{3k + 7}{k + 1} \right| = 2\)
Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:
\(\left| \frac{3k + 7}{k + 1} \right| = 4\)

**4. Solve for \(k\)**
The absolute value equation gives two possibilities:
Possibility 1: \(\frac{3k + 7}{k + 1} = 4\)
\(3k + 7 = 4(k + 1)\)
\(3k + 7 = 4k + 4\)
\(7 - 4 = 4k - 3k\)
**\(3 = k\)**

Possibility 2: \(\frac{3k + 7}{k + 1} = -4\)
\(3k + 7 = -4(k + 1)\)
\(3k + 7 = -4k - 4\)
\(3k + 4k = -4 - 7\)
\(7k = -11\)
\(k = -\frac{11}{7}\)

**5. Identify the Positive Value of \(k\)**
The problem asks for the **positive value of \(k\)**. The possible values we found are 3 and \(-\frac{11}{7}\).
Since point B divides the line segment AC internally in the ratio \(k:1\), \(k\) must be a positive value (a negative value for \(k\) would correspond to external division, which is not stated in the problem).
Therefore, the positive value of \(k\) is 3.

The final answer is $\boxed{3}$.

Based on the sources and our conversation history, we can address your query about finding the value of the constant \(c\) that minimizes the Sum Squared Error (SSE) for the given function.

The sources define the **Sum Squared Error (SSE)** as the sum of the squares of the deviations of the predicted linear model from the actual data set. For a line of fit \(y = mx + c\) and a set of \(n\) points \((x_i, y_i)\), the SSE is calculated as \(\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - (m x_i + c))^2\). The goal of finding the "best fit" line is to find the values of \(m\) and \(c\) that minimize this SSE. This minimization involves dealing with terms that are squares of something.

In your query, you have a function of the form \(f(x) = -(x-1)^2 (x-3)(x-5)(x-7) + c\), which is a polynomial function of degree 5, where \(c\) is a constant that shifts the function vertically. You want to find the value of \(c\) that minimizes the SSE with respect to some recorded data (Table 1), which we can assume consists of \(n\) points \((x_i, y_i)\) for \(i=1, 2, \dots, n\).

The SSE for this function and the data points \((x_i, y_i)\) would be the sum of the squared differences between the actual \(y_i\) values and the values predicted by the function \(f(x_i)\).
Let \(h(x) = -(x-1)^2 (x-3)(x-5)(x-7)\). Then the function is \(f(x) = h(x) + c\).
The SSE, as a function of \(c\), is:
\(SSE(c) = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - f(x_i))^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - (h(x_i) + c))^2\)
\(SSE(c) = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - h(x_i) - c)^2\)

To find the value of \(c\) that minimizes \(SSE(c)\), we can use calculus. The minimum of a differentiable function occurs at a **critical point**, where the **derivative** of the function with respect to the variable we are minimizing over is zero. In this case, we want to find the critical point of \(SSE(c)\) with respect to \(c\).

We take the derivative of \(SSE(c)\) with respect to \(c\):
\(\frac{dSSE}{dc} = \frac{d}{dc} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - h(x_i) - c)^2\)
Using the linearity of differentiation and the chain rule:
\(\frac{dSSE}{dc} = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{d}{dc} (y_i - h(x_i) - c)^2\)
\(\frac{dSSE}{dc} = \sum_{i=1}^n 2(y_i - h(x_i) - c) \cdot (-1)\)
\(\frac{dSSE}{dc} = -2 \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - h(x_i) - c)\)

Now, we set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical point:
\(-2 \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - h(x_i) - c) = 0\)
Dividing by -2:
\(\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - h(x_i) - c) = 0\)
We can split the summation:
\(\sum_{i=1}^n y_i - \sum_{i=1}^n h(x_i) - \sum_{i=1}^n c = 0\)
\(\sum_{i=1}^n y_i - \sum_{i=1}^n h(x_i) - nc = 0\)
Solving for \(c\):
\(nc = \sum_{i=1}^n y_i - \sum_{i=1}^n h(x_i)\)
\(c = \frac{1}{n} \left( \sum_{i=1}^n y_i - \sum_{i=1}^n h(x_i) \right)\)
\(c = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n y_i}{n} - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n h(x_i)}{n}\)

This equation shows that the value of \(c\) that minimizes the SSE is the difference between the mean of the actual \(y_i\) values and the mean of the values of the function \(h(x) = -(x-1)^2 (x-3)(x-5)(x-7)\) evaluated at the data points' \(x_i\) values. This value of \(c\) will correspond to a minimum because the second derivative of \(SSE(c)\) with respect to \(c\) is \(\frac{d^2SSE}{dc^2} = \frac{d}{dc} \left( -2 \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - h(x_i) - c) \right) = -2 \sum_{i=1}^n (-1) = 2n\), which is positive (assuming \(n > 0\)), indicating a minimum.

The derived formula for \(c\) depends on the specific data points \((x_i, y_i)\) from Table 1. Since the data points from Table 1 are not provided in your query or the sources, **a specific numerical value for \(c\) cannot be determined at this time.** However, the value of \(c\) that minimizes the SSE is given by the formula:
\(c = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n y_i - \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \left( -(x_i-1)^2 (x_i-3)(x_i-5)(x_i-7) \right)\), where \(n\) is the number of data points in Table 1, and \((x_i, y_i)\) are those data points.

Okay, let's find the point where the bird and the aeroplane might collide based on their paths and then calculate the sum of the coordinates of this point.

The path of the bird is given by the straight line equation \(2y - 6x = 6\).
We can rewrite this equation in the slope-intercept form, \(y = mx + c\), to understand its properties.
Starting with \(2y - 6x = 6\):
Add \(6x\) to both sides:
\(2y = 6x + 6\)
Divide by 2:
\(y = 3x + 3\)
This is the equation for the bird's path. It represents a straight line with a slope of 3 and a y-intercept of 3.

The aeroplane follows a straight line path with a slope of 2 and passes through the point (4, 8).
To find the equation of this line, we can use the point-slope form of a straight line, which is \((y - y_1) = m(x - x_1)\).
Given the slope \(m = 2\) and the point \((x_1, y_1) = (4, 8)\), we substitute these values into the formula:
\(y - 8 = 2(x - 4)\)
\(y - 8 = 2x - 8\)
Add 8 to both sides:
\(y = 2x - 8 + 8\)
\(y = 2x\)
This is the equation for the aeroplane's path. It is a straight line with a slope of 2 and a y-intercept of 0.

The point where the bird and the aeroplane can collide is the point of intersection of their paths. This point, denoted by \((\alpha, \beta)\), is the unique point that lies on both straight lines. Therefore, its coordinates must satisfy the equations of both lines simultaneously.

We have the system of equations:
1.  \(y = 3x + 3\)
2.  \(y = 2x\)

To find the coordinates of the intersection point \((\alpha, \beta)\), we can solve this system. Using substitution (substituting the expression for \(y\) from the second equation into the first equation), we get:
\(2x = 3x + 3\)
Subtract \(2x\) from both sides:
\(0 = 3x - 2x + 3\)
\(0 = x + 3\)
**\(x = -3\)**

Now substitute the value of \(x\) back into either equation to find \(y\). Using the equation \(y = 2x\):
\(y = 2(-3)\)
**\(y = -6\)**

So, the point of collision \((\alpha, \beta)\) is \((-3, -6)\).
Therefore, \(\alpha = -3\) and \(\beta = -6\).

The question asks for the value of \(\alpha + \beta\).
\(\alpha + \beta = -3 + (-6)\)
\(\alpha + \beta = -3 - 6\)
**\(\alpha + \beta = -9\)**

The sources discuss the representation of points and lines in the rectangular coordinate system, the concept of slope, and various forms for the equation of a straight line, including the slope-intercept form \(y=mx+c\) and the point-slope form \((y-y_1) = m(x-x_1)\). The idea that a point's coordinates satisfy the equation of a line it lies on is also present. While the provided source excerpts do not explicitly detail the method for solving systems of linear equations, determining the point that satisfies the equations of both lines aligns with the geometric principles described.

The value of \(\alpha + \beta\) is -9.

To find the area of triangle \(\triangle MNO\), we first need to determine the coordinates of points M, N, and O using the given information and the relevant formulas from the sources. The rectangular coordinate system allows us to uniquely identify points on a plane using an ordered pair \((x, y)\), where \(x\) is the horizontal coordinate and \(y\) is the vertical coordinate.

The coordinates of the vertices of triangle \(\triangle ABC\) are given as A\((-3, 3)\), B\((1, 7)\), and C\((2, -2)\).

**Finding the coordinates of point M:**
Point M divides the line segment AB in the ratio 1:3. We can use the section formula for internal division. If a point \((x, y)\) divides the line segment connecting \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) in the ratio \(m:n\), its coordinates are given by \(x = \frac{mx_2 + nx_1}{m+n}\) and \(y = \frac{my_2 + ny_1}{m+n}\).
For point M, \((x_1, y_1) = (-3, 3)\), \((x_2, y_2) = (1, 7)\), \(m = 1\), and \(n = 3\).
The x-coordinate of M is \(x_M = \frac{1 \times 1 + 3 \times (-3)}{1+3} = \frac{1 - 9}{4} = \frac{-8}{4} = -2\).
The y-coordinate of M is \(y_M = \frac{1 \times 7 + 3 \times 3}{1+3} = \frac{7 + 9}{4} = \frac{16}{4} = 4\).
So, the coordinates of point M are \((-2, 4)\).

**Finding the coordinates of point N:**
Point N divides the line segment AC in the ratio 2:3. Using the same section formula:
For point N, \((x_1, y_1) = (-3, 3)\), \((x_2, y_2) = (2, -2)\), \(m = 2\), and \(n = 3\).
The x-coordinate of N is \(x_N = \frac{2 \times 2 + 3 \times (-3)}{2+3} = \frac{4 - 9}{5} = \frac{-5}{5} = -1\).
The y-coordinate of N is \(y_N = \frac{2 \times (-2) + 3 \times 3}{2+3} = \frac{-4 + 9}{5} = \frac{5}{5} = 1\).
So, the coordinates of point N are \((-1, 1)\).

**Finding the coordinates of point O:**
Point O is the mid-point of the line segment BC. The midpoint formula is a special case of the section formula where the ratio is 1:1. The coordinates of the midpoint of \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) are \(\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right)\).
For point O, \((x_1, y_1) = (1, 7)\) and \((x_2, y_2) = (2, -2)\).
The x-coordinate of O is \(x_O = \frac{1 + 2}{2} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5\).
The y-coordinate of O is \(y_O = \frac{7 + (-2)}{2} = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5\).
So, the coordinates of point O are \((1.5, 2.5)\).

**Finding the area of triangle \(\triangle MNO\):**
Now that we have the coordinates of the vertices of triangle \(\triangle MNO\), which are M\((-2, 4)\), N\((-1, 1)\), and O\((1.5, 2.5)\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given its vertices. The area \(\triangle\) of a triangle with vertices \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) is given by \(\triangle = \frac{1}{2} |x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2)|\). The modulus is used to ensure the area is always positive.
Let \((x_1, y_1) = (-2, 4)\), \((x_2, y_2) = (-1, 1)\), and \((x_3, y_3) = (1.5, 2.5)\).
Area of \(\triangle MNO = \frac{1}{2} |(-2)(1 - 2.5) + (-1)(2.5 - 4) + (1.5)(4 - 1)|\)
Area of \(\triangle MNO = \frac{1}{2} |(-2)(-1.5) + (-1)(-1.5) + (1.5)(3)|\)
Area of \(\triangle MNO = \frac{1}{2} |3 + 1.5 + 4.5|\)
Area of \(\triangle MNO = \frac{1}{2} |9|\)
Area of \(\triangle MNO = \frac{1}{2} \times 9\)
Area of \(\triangle MNO = 4.5\)

The area of triangle \(\triangle MNO\) is **4.5 square units**.

Based on the information provided and drawing upon the sources, we can determine the equations of the two lines, L1 and L2, and then find their point of intersection.

The rectangular coordinate system allows us to denote any point on a plane using an ordered pair \((x, y)\). A straight line in this plane can be represented by an algebraic equation in terms of these coordinates. The sources discuss various forms for the equation of a straight line, including the slope-intercept form \(y = mx + c\), the point-slope form \((y - y_1) = m(x - x_1)\), the two-point form \((y - y_1) = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}(x - x_1)\), and the intercept form \( \frac{x}{a} + \frac{y}{b} = 1 \).

The **x-intercept** is the point where a line crosses the x-axis, and its y-coordinate is 0. The **y-intercept** is the point where a line crosses the y-axis, and its x-coordinate is 0. In the intercept form \( \frac{x}{a} + \frac{y}{b} = 1 \), 'a' is the x-intercept and 'b' is the y-intercept.

**For line L1:**
The x-intercept is 2, and the y-intercept is -3.
Using the intercept form \( \frac{x}{a} + \frac{y}{b} = 1 \) with \(a=2\) and \(b=-3\):
\( \frac{x}{2} + \frac{y}{-3} = 1 \)
To eliminate fractions, we can multiply the entire equation by the least common multiple of 2 and 3, which is 6:
\( 6 \times \frac{x}{2} + 6 \times \frac{y}{-3} = 6 \times 1 \)
\( 3x - 2y = 6 \)

Alternatively, we can use the points corresponding to the intercepts: (2, 0) and (0, -3). The slope \(m\) of the line L1 can be calculated as \(m_1 = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\).
\(m_1 = \frac{-3 - 0}{0 - 2} = \frac{-3}{-2} = \frac{3}{2}\).
Using the slope-intercept form \(y = mx + c\), where \(c\) is the y-intercept, the equation for L1 is \( y = \frac{3}{2}x - 3 \).
We can verify that \(y = \frac{3}{2}x - 3\) is equivalent to \(3x - 2y = 6\). Multiply by 2: \(2y = 3x - 6\). Rearrange: \(3x - 2y = 6\).

**For line L2:**
The x-intercept is -1, and the y-intercept is 2.
Using the intercept form \( \frac{x}{a} + \frac{y}{b} = 1 \) with \(a=-1\) and \(b=2\):
\( \frac{x}{-1} + \frac{y}{2} = 1 \)
Multiply the entire equation by -2:
\( -2 \times \frac{x}{-1} + (-2) \times \frac{y}{2} = -2 \times 1 \)
\( 2x - y = -2 \)

Alternatively, using the points (-1, 0) and (0, 2), the slope \(m\) of L2 is:
\(m_2 = \frac{2 - 0}{0 - (-1)} = \frac{2}{1} = 2\).
Using the slope-intercept form \(y = mx + c\), the equation for L2 is \( y = 2x + 2 \).
We can verify that \(y = 2x + 2\) is equivalent to \(2x - y = -2\). Rearrange: \(2x - y = -2\).

The point where the lines L1 and L2 intersect is the point whose coordinates satisfy the equations of both lines simultaneously. We need to solve the system of linear equations:
1. \( 3x - 2y = 6 \)
2. \( 2x - y = -2 \)

From the second equation, we can express \(y\) in terms of \(x\):
\( -y = -2x - 2 \)
\( y = 2x + 2 \)

Substitute this expression for \(y\) into the first equation:
\( 3x - 2(2x + 2) = 6 \)
\( 3x - 4x - 4 = 6 \)
\( -x - 4 = 6 \)
Add 4 to both sides:
\( -x = 6 + 4 \)
\( -x = 10 \)
Multiply by -1:
**\( x = -10 \)**

Now substitute the value of \(x\) back into the equation for \(y\):
\( y = 2x + 2 \)
\( y = 2(-10) + 2 \)
\( y = -20 + 2 \)
**\( y = -18 \)**

The point of intersection is \((-10, -18)\).

Comparing this point with the given options:
(10, 18)
(5, 8)
**(−10, −18)**
(6, 6)

The point where L1 and L2 intersect is **(−10, −18)**.

Drawing on the information from the sources and our conversation history, we can determine the tangent of the angle between the lines L1 and L2.

From our previous turn, we established the equations for the two lines:
Line L1: \(3x - 2y = 6\)
Line L2: \(2x - y = -2\)

To find the angle between these lines, we first need to find their slopes. The sources define the slope of a line. For a linear equation in the form \(ax + by + c = 0\), the slope is given by \(-\frac{a}{b}\).

For line L1, the equation is \(3x - 2y - 6 = 0\). Here, \(a=3\) and \(b=-2\).
The slope of L1, denoted by \(m_1\), is \(m_1 = -\frac{3}{-2} = \frac{3}{2}\).

For line L2, the equation is \(2x - y + 2 = 0\). Here, \(a=2\) and \(b=-1\).
The slope of L2, denoted by \(m_2\), is \(m_2 = -\frac{2}{-1} = 2\).

The sources provide a formula for the tangent of the angle between two lines with slopes \(m_1\) and \(m_2\). If \(\theta\) is one of the angles of intersection, then \(\tan\theta = \frac{m_2 - m_1}{1 + m_2m_1}\).

Substituting the calculated slopes \(m_1 = \frac{3}{2}\) and \(m_2 = 2\) into this formula:
\(\tan\theta = \frac{2 - \frac{3}{2}}{1 + (2)(\frac{3}{2})}\)
\(\tan\theta = \frac{\frac{4}{2} - \frac{3}{2}}{1 + \frac{6}{2}}\)
\(\tan\theta = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{1 + 3}\)
\(\tan\theta = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{4}\)
\(\tan\theta = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{4}\)
**\(\tan\theta = \frac{1}{8}\)**

The other adjacent angle between the lines, often denoted by \(\phi\), would have a tangent given by \(\tan\phi = \frac{m_1 - m_2}{1 + m_1m_2}\).
\(\tan\phi = \frac{\frac{3}{2} - 2}{1 + (\frac{3}{2})(2)} = \frac{-\frac{1}{2}}{4} = -\frac{1}{8}\).
The tangent of one angle is the negative of the tangent of the adjacent angle. Since the options are all positive, the question is likely referring to the acute angle between the lines, which corresponds to the positive value of the tangent.

The value of \(\tan\theta\) is \(\frac{1}{8}\).

Let's compare this with the given options:
**\(\frac{1}{8}\)**
\(\frac{1}{6}\)
\(\frac{3}{8}\)
\(\frac{1}{4}\)

The point where L1 and L2 intersect was previously found to be \((-10, -18)\). While this is the intersection point, the calculation of the angle between the lines depends on their slopes, not the specific intersection point.

The tangent of the angle between L1 and L2 is \(\frac{1}{8}\).

To find the area of the triangle ABC, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle when the coordinates of its vertices are given. The sources explain that the area of a triangle \(\triangle\) formed by three points, \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) in the XY plane is \(\triangle = \frac{1}{2} |x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2)|\). The modulus (absolute value) is used to ensure that the area is always a positive value. The rectangular coordinate system allows us to identify the location of points in a plane using ordered pairs \((x, y)\).

The coordinates of the vertices of triangle ABC are given as A(4, 3), B(2, 2), and C(8, 3).
Let's assign the coordinates to the formula variables:
\((x_1, y_1) = A(4, 3)\)
\((x_2, y_2) = B(2, 2)\)
\((x_3, y_3) = C(8, 3)\)

Now, we can substitute these coordinates into the area formula:
Area of \(\triangle ABC = \frac{1}{2} |x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2)|\)
Area of \(\triangle ABC = \frac{1}{2} |4(2 - 3) + 2(3 - 3) + 8(3 - 2)|\)
Area of \(\triangle ABC = \frac{1}{2} |4(-1) + 2(0) + 8(1)|\)
Area of \(\triangle ABC = \frac{1}{2} |-4 + 0 + 8|\)
Area of \(\triangle ABC = \frac{1}{2} |4|\)
Area of \(\triangle ABC = \frac{1}{2} \times 4\)
**Area of \(\triangle ABC = 2\)**

Therefore, the area of the triangle ABC is **2 square units**.

The information regarding triangle PAB and the relationship between the areas of the two triangles was not required to determine the area of triangle ABC.

Based on the information provided and our previous calculations, we can determine the possible coordinates of point P.

First, we need to find the area of triangle ABC. The coordinates of the vertices are A(4, 3), B(2, 2), and C(8, 3). The area of a triangle formed by three points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) in the XY plane is given by the formula \(\triangle = \frac{1}{2} |x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2)|\). The modulus is used because the area must be positive.

Using the coordinates of A, B, and C:
Area of \(\triangle ABC = \frac{1}{2} |4(2 - 3) + 2(3 - 3) + 8(3 - 2)|\)
Area of \(\triangle ABC = \frac{1}{2} |4(-1) + 2(0) + 8(1)|\)
Area of \(\triangle ABC = \frac{1}{2} |-4 + 0 + 8|\)
Area of \(\triangle ABC = \frac{1}{2} |4|\)
Area of \(\triangle ABC = \frac{1}{2} \times 4\)
Area of \(\triangle ABC = 2\).

The problem states that the area of triangle ABC is 4 times the area of triangle PAB.
Area of \(\triangle ABC = 4 \times \) Area of \(\triangle PAB\)
\(2 = 4 \times \) Area of \(\triangle PAB\)
Area of \(\triangle PAB = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}\).

Now, we need to find the possible coordinates of point P\((t, t²)\). The vertices of triangle PAB are A(4, 3), B(2, 2), and P\((t, t²)\). Using the area formula for triangle PAB:
Area of \(\triangle PAB = \frac{1}{2} |x_A(y_B - y_P) + x_B(y_P - y_A) + x_P(y_A - y_B)|\)
Area of \(\triangle PAB = \frac{1}{2} |4(2 - t²) + 2(t² - 3) + t(3 - 2)|\)
Area of \(\triangle PAB = \frac{1}{2} |8 - 4t² + 2t² - 6 + t(1)|\)
Area of \(\triangle PAB = \frac{1}{2} |8 - 6 - 4t² + 2t² + t|\)
Area of \(\triangle PAB = \frac{1}{2} |2 - 2t² + t|\)
Area of \(\triangle PAB = \frac{1}{2} |t - 2t² + 2|\).

We know that the Area of \(\triangle PAB = \frac{1}{2}\), so:
\(\frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} |t - 2t² + 2|\)
Multiplying both sides by 2 gives:
\(1 = |t - 2t² + 2|\).

This absolute value equation leads to two separate equations:
Case 1: \(t - 2t² + 2 = 1\)
Rearranging the terms, we get a quadratic equation:
\(2t² - t - 1 = 0\).
We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring or using the quadratic formula. By factoring, we look for two numbers that multiply to \(2 \times -1 = -2\) and add up to -1. These numbers are -2 and 1.
\(2t² - 2t + t - 1 = 0\)
\(2t(t - 1) + 1(t - 1) = 0\)
\((2t + 1)(t - 1) = 0\)
This gives two possible values for \(t\):
\(2t + 1 = 0 \implies t = -\frac{1}{2}\)
\(t - 1 = 0 \implies t = 1\)

Case 2: \(t - 2t² + 2 = -1\)
Rearranging the terms, we get a quadratic equation:
\(2t² - t - 3 = 0\).
By factoring, we look for two numbers that multiply to \(2 \times -3 = -6\) and add up to -1. These numbers are -3 and 2.
\(2t² - 3t + 2t - 3 = 0\)
\(t(2t - 3) + 1(2t - 3) = 0\)
\((t + 1)(2t - 3) = 0\)
This gives two possible values for \(t\):
\(t + 1 = 0 \implies t = -1\)
\(2t - 3 = 0 \implies t = \frac{3}{2}\)

The possible values for \(t\) are \(1, -\frac{1}{2}, -1, \frac{3}{2}\).
The coordinates of point P are given by \((t, t²)\). Substituting the possible values of \(t\), we find the possible coordinates for P:
If \(t = 1\), P is \((1, 1²)\) = \((1, 1)\).
If \(t = -\frac{1}{2}\), P is \((-\frac{1}{2}, (-\frac{1}{2})²)\) = \((-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4})\).
If \(t = -1\), P is \((-1, (-1)²)\) = \((-1, 1)\).
If \(t = \frac{3}{2}\), P is \((\frac{3}{2}, (\frac{3}{2})²)\) = \((\frac{3}{2}, \frac{9}{4})\).

The possible coordinates for point P are \((1, 1)\), \((-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4})\), \((-1, 1)\), and \((\frac{3}{2}, \frac{9}{4})\).

Now, we check which of the given options match these possible coordinates:
- (0, 0): This would require \(t=0\) and \(t²=0\). \(t=0\) is not one of our calculated values for \(t\).
- (2, 4): This would require \(t=2\) and \(t²=4\). \(t=2\) is not one of our calculated values for \(t\).
- (−2, 4): This would require \(t=-2\) and \(t²=4\). \(t=-2\) is not one of our calculated values for \(t\).
- **(−1, 1)**: This would require \(t=-1\) and \(t²=1\). \(t=-1\) is one of our calculated values for \(t\), and \((-1)² = 1\). This point matches.

Based on our calculations, only the point \((-1, 1)\) from the provided options is a possible location for P.

The final answer is \(\boxed{(-1, 1)}\).

Based on your query and the information available in the sources, I can explain the concept of Sum Squared Error (SSE) and why I need more information to calculate it for Radhika's data.

You've provided the equation of a best-fit line for Radhika's expense data, which is \(y = 4x + 2\), where \(y\) is the amount spent on entertainment and \(x\) is the number of outings. This equation is in the standard slope-intercept form \(y = mx + c\), where \(m\) represents the slope of the line and \(c\) represents the y-intercept. In this case, the slope \(m\) is 4, and the y-intercept \(c\) is 2. The slope indicates the steepness and direction of the line, while the y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis.

You're asking about the **Sum Squared Error (SSE)** in relation to this best-fit line. The sources describe SSE as the **sum of the squares of the deviations of the predicted linear model from the actual data set**. It's a measure used to evaluate how well a line fits a set of data points.

The formula for SSE, given a set of \(n\) data points \((x_i, y_i)\) and a line of fit \(y = mx + c\), is:
\[ \text{SSE} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - (m x_i + c))^2 \]
In this formula:
*   \(x_i\) and \(y_i\) are the actual coordinate values of each data point from your table.
*   \(m x_i + c\) is the value of \(y\) predicted by the best-fit line for a given \(x_i\).
*   The term \((y_i - (m x_i + c))\) represents the difference between the actual observed value (\(y_i\)) and the value predicted by the line for that \(x_i\). This can be thought of as the vertical distance between the data point \((x_i, y_i)\) and the line \(y = mx + c\).
*   Squaring this difference \((y_i - (m x_i + c))^2\) makes the value positive and gives more weight to larger errors.
*   The sum \(\sum_{i=1}^{n}\) adds up these squared differences for all the data points.

The objective when finding a best-fit line is often to find the values of \(m\) and \(c\) that minimize this SSE.

You mentioned that you have a table with two rows representing the amount spent (\(y\)) and the number of outings (\(x\)). However, the actual numerical values from this table are not included in your query. To calculate the SSE, I need the specific coordinate pairs \((x_i, y_i)\) for each observation Radhika tracked.

Once you provide the data points from the table, I can substitute them into the SSE formula using \(m=4\) and \(c=2\) to compute the exact value of the Sum Squared Error for Radhika's best-fit line.

Could you please provide the data from the table?
