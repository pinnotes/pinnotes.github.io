#### 1. Consider three Airports A, B, and C. Two friends Ananya and Madhuri want to meet at Airport C. Ananya Boarded Flight 1 from Point A to C which is 1200 km, due to bad weather, Flight 1 slowed down, and the average speed was reduced by 200 km/h and the time increased by 30 minutes. Madhuri boarded Flight 2 from Point B to C which is 1800 km, the average speed of Flight 2 is 720 km/h. What is the waiting time, and who will be waiting at the airport? (Given Ananya and Madhuri boarded at the same time)

Waiting Time is 1 hr and Ananya is waiting.

Waiting Time is 1 hr and Madhuri is waiting.

Waiting Time is 30 min and Ananya is waiting.

Waiting Time is 30 min and Madhuri is waiting.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Determine Ananya's Flight Details:**
    - Let Ananya's original speed be \$ x \$ km/h.
    - Original time: \$ \frac{1200}{x} \$ hours.
    - Reduced speed: \$ x - 200 \$ km/h.
    - New time: \$ \frac{1200}{x - 200} \$ hours.
    - Time increased by 30 minutes (0.5 hours):

$$
\frac{1200}{x - 200} - \frac{1200}{x} = 0.5
$$
2. **Solve for \$ x \$:**
   
- Multiply through by \$ x(x - 200) \$:

$$
1200x - 1200(x - 200) = 0.5x(x - 200)
$$

- Simplify:

$$
240000 = 0.5x^2 - 100x \implies x^2 - 200x - 480000 = 0
$$

- Solve the quadratic equation:

$$
x = \frac{200 \pm \sqrt{(200)^2 + 4 \cdot 480000}}{2} = \frac{200 \pm 1400}{2}
$$

- Valid solution: \$ x = 800 \$ km/h (original speed).
  
1. **Calculate Flight Times:**
    - **Ananya's new time:** \$ \frac{1200}{800 - 200} = 2 \$ hours.
    - **Madhuri's time:** \$ \frac{1800}{720} = 2.5 \$ hours.
2. **Determine Waiting Time:**
    - Ananya arrives in **2 hours**, Madhuri in **2.5 hours**.
    - **Waiting time:** \$ 2.5 - 2 = 0.5 \$ hours (30 minutes).
    - **Who waits:** Madhuri arrives later, so **Ananya waits**.

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{Waiting Time is 30 min and Ananya is waiting.}
