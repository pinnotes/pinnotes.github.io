**1**. 'This book is necessary for me to do my research.’ In this sentence, the subordinate clause is

**A**. Is necessary

**B**. This book is necessary

**C**. For me

**D**. For me to do my research
{{< /border >}}

{{< border type="tip" title="Explanation" >}}
In the sentence "**This book is necessary for me to do my research**," the subordinate clause is **D) For me to do my research**.

Here's an explanation based on the provided sources:

*   A **subordinate clause**, also known as an **embedded clause**, is a sentence-like structure that is **dependent** on a main clause (or independent clause) and cannot stand alone as a complete thought. When a main clause contains at least one additional clause, the entire sentence becomes a **complex sentence**.
*   Subordinate clauses have a subject and a predicate, just like an independent sentence. However, they often lack the independent status of a full sentence.
*   The additional clause can be of various types, including **nominal** (working like a noun), **adjectival** (working as an adjective to modify a noun), or **adverbial** (giving additional information, often functioning as an adjunct).
*   The sources specifically mention **infinitival clauses** (also called **non-finite sentences**) as a type of clause. These clauses use verbs in their infinitive form (e.g., "to do," "to go") and typically do not have tense or agreement markers. A key characteristic of non-finite clauses is that they **cannot become independent clauses** by themselves.

Let's break down the given sentence:
*   The **main clause** is "**This book is necessary**" [As per my analysis]. This part has a subject ("This book") and a predicate ("is necessary") and can stand on its own, meeting the requirements of a sentence.
*   The phrase "**for me to do my research**" functions as a **subordinate clause**.
    *   It contains a logical subject ("me") for the action and a non-finite verb ("to do").
    *   This is an example of an **infinitival clause** (a non-finite clause).
    *   Its function in the sentence is to provide **additional information** about *why* the book is necessary, making it an adverbial clause or an adjunct.
    *   Crucially, this clause cannot stand alone as a complete sentence, indicating its dependent nature.

Therefore, among the given options:
*   **A) Is necessary:** This is part of the predicate of the main clause, not a separate clause. A clause must contain a subject and a verb.
*   **B) This book is necessary:** This is the **main clause** of the sentence, not a subordinate one.
*   **C) For me:** This is a prepositional phrase, but it is not a complete clause as it lacks a verb.
*   **D) For me to do my research:** This is the complete **subordinate clause** (specifically, a non-finite infinitival clause) that clarifies the purpose for which the book is necessary.

**2**. A simple sentence has ______.

**A**. Two independent clauses

**B**. An independent clause and many dependent clauses

**C**. An independent clause

**D**. All of the above

{{< /border >}}

{{< border type="tip" title="Explanation" >}}
A simple sentence has **C) An independent clause**.

Here's a detailed explanation:

*   A **simple sentence** is defined as a sentence that has an **independent status**. This means it can stand alone as a complete thought.
*   By definition, **all simple sentences are independent clauses**. An independent clause is also known as a **main clause** or a **matrix clause**.
*   A simple sentence typically consists of a **subject** and a **predicate**. Within its predicate, there is **only one main verb**.
*   For example, "everyone needs a coach" is cited as an example of a **simple sentence** that has a subject, a verb, and an object, making it a **canonical sentence**. Similarly, "Raju likes flowers" is presented as a simple, canonical English sentence that fulfills all requirements with a subject and a predicate.
*   Simple sentences structurally **do not depend on any other clause**.

To contrast, the other options describe different sentence types:
*   **Two independent clauses** describe a **compound sentence**. In a compound sentence, two or more independent sentences are joined together, often by connectors like 'and', 'or', or a comma.
*   **An independent clause and many dependent clauses** describe a **complex sentence**. A complex sentence contains a main clause (independent clause) and at least one additional clause, which is a subordinate or embedded clause. These additional clauses can be nominal, adjectival, or adverbial in nature.

**3**. 'The vegetables, which I bought only yesterday, are beginning to spoil.’ The independent clause is

**A**. The vegetables which I bought only yesterday

**B**. The vegetables are beginning to spoil

**C**. Which I bought only yesterday

**D**. Which I bought only yesterday are beginning to spoil
{{< /border >}}

{{< border type="tip" title="Explanation" >}}
In the sentence "**The vegetables, which I bought only yesterday, are beginning to spoil**," the independent clause is **B) The vegetables are beginning to spoil**.

Here's a breakdown based on the provided sources and our conversation:

*   An **independent clause**, also known as a **main clause** or a **matrix clause**, is a fundamental component of a sentence [Source 2, 578, 586, 592].
*   It has **independent status**, meaning it can **stand alone as a complete thought or sentence** [Source 2, 578].
*   Every independent clause must contain both a **subject** and a **predicate** [Source 592, 619]. Structurally, it **does not depend on any other clause** [Source 592].
*   A simple sentence is, by definition, an independent clause [Source 2, 593].
*   When an independent clause contains at least one **additional clause** (also known as a **subordinate** or **embedded clause**), the entire construction becomes a **complex sentence** [Source 2, 61, 68, 578].

Let's apply this to the given sentence:

1.  **"The vegetables are beginning to spoil"**:
    *   This part functions as the **main clause** or **independent clause** [Source 2].
    *   It has a **subject** ("The vegetables") and a **predicate** ("are beginning to spoil") [Source 592, 619].
    *   It conveys a **complete thought** and can stand alone as a grammatical sentence.

2.  **"which I bought only yesterday"**:
    *   This part is a **subordinate clause**, specifically an **adjectival (relative) clause** [Source 2, 4, 5, 8, 101].
    *   It begins with the relative pronoun "which" [Source 8, 101] and provides **additional information** about the noun "vegetables" [Source 2, 4, 5].
    *   Crucially, this clause **cannot stand alone as a complete sentence**; it is dependent on the main clause for its full meaning [Source 63, 578, 579, 592]. Its removal would not make the main clause ungrammatical, although it would remove specific details.

Therefore, comparing the options:
*   **A) The vegetables which I bought only yesterday**: This combines the subject of the main clause with the subordinate clause, but it is incomplete because the main verb of the main clause ("are beginning to spoil") is missing.
*   **B) The vegetables are beginning to spoil**: This is a complete thought with a subject and a predicate that can stand independently, fitting the definition of an independent clause.
*   **C) Which I bought only yesterday**: This is the subordinate clause, which is dependent and cannot stand alone as a full sentence.
*   **D) Which I bought only yesterday are beginning to spoil**: This option combines the subordinate clause with the predicate of the main clause, making it grammatically incorrect and unable to stand alone.

Thus, **The vegetables are beginning to spoil** is the independent clause in the complex sentence.

**4**. 'The CEO of the company along with the board members passed a new resolution yesterday’. This sentence has two adjuncts.

**A**. True

**B**. False 
{{< /border >}}

{{< border type="tip" title="Explanation" >}}
The statement "**A. True**" is correct. The sentence "The CEO of the company along with the board members passed a new resolution yesterday" indeed has **two adjuncts**.

Let's break down the sentence to understand why:

1.  **Understanding Adjuncts**:
    *   An **adjunct** is a word or a set of words that typically **modifies or describes a verb**, an adjective, or another adverb.
    *   Adjuncts provide **additional information** and are **not contingent upon the verb's nature**; their presence or absence does not dictate the grammatical completeness of a sentence. This means that if an adjunct is removed, the sentence can still remain grammatical.
    *   They often express information about *when*, *where*, or *how* an action is performed, or indicate the *quality or degree* of the action.
    *   Adjuncts can appear as **prepositional phrases** (e.g., "in the morning," "with his friends," "after dinner") that add details related to the verb.
    *   A sentence can contain **multiple adjuncts**.

2.  **Analysing the Sentence**:

    *   **"The CEO of the company"**: This is the **subject** of the sentence. Within this noun phrase, "of the company" functions as a **complement** to the noun "CEO," similar to "of England" being a complement to "King" in "The King of England". Complements are required elements that complete the meaning of a head (like a noun or verb).
    *   **"along with the board members"**: This phrase provides **additional information** about *who* was accompanying the CEO when the resolution was passed. It functions as an adverbial phrase of accompaniment or manner. Its removal ("The CEO of the company passed a new resolution yesterday") still leaves a grammatically complete sentence. Therefore, this is the **first adjunct**.
    *   **"passed"**: This is the **main verb** of the sentence.
    *   **"a new resolution"**: This is the **direct object** of the transitive verb "passed". Objects are generally considered **complements** because they are required by the verb to complete its meaning.
    *   **"yesterday"**: This word specifies *when* the action of passing the resolution occurred. It provides an additional detail about time and its removal ("The CEO of the company along with the board members passed a new resolution") leaves a grammatically complete sentence. Therefore, this is the **second adjunct**.

In summary, the sentence contains two elements that fit the definition and function of adjuncts:
1.  **"along with the board members"**
2.  **"yesterday"**

Since both "along with the board members" and "yesterday" are optional elements that provide additional information about the action, the sentence indeed has two adjuncts.

**5**. ‘The book with the blue cover on the shelf in the drawing room is the one that you gave me.’ This sentence has ____ adjuncts.

**A**. 1

**B**. 2

**C**. 3

**D**. 4
{{< /border >}}

{{< border type="tip" title="Explanation" >}}
In the sentence "**The book with the blue cover on the shelf in the drawing room is the one that you gave me**," there are **three adjuncts**.

Let's break down the sentence to identify these elements, based on the definitions provided in the sources:

*   An **adjunct** is a word or a set of words that provides **additional information** and is **structurally dispensable**; its presence or absence does not dictate the grammatical completeness of a sentence. Adjuncts can modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, and they often express *when*, *where*, or *how* an action is performed. Importantly, adjuncts can also be **prepositional phrases** that add details related to a verb or even a **noun phrase**. A sentence can contain multiple adjuncts.
*   In contrast, **complements** are essential and **structurally indispensable** parts of a sentence, such as objects, which are required by the verb to complete its meaning.

Now, let's analyse the given sentence:

1.  **"The book is the one"**: This is the **main clause** of the sentence. "The book" is the subject, and "is the one" is the predicate, where "the one" functions as a complement of the verb "is". This part can stand alone as a complete sentence.

2.  **"that you gave me"**: This is an **adjectival (relative) clause**. It modifies "the one" (which refers back to "the book") by providing descriptive information, functioning like an adjective. While it's a subordinate clause that adds information, it's typically classified by its adjectival function rather than as an adjunct in the same way adverbial phrases are. The sources define adjuncts primarily as modifiers of verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, or as prepositional phrases that act in a similar modifying capacity for either verbs or noun phrases.

3.  **"with the blue cover"**: This is a **prepositional phrase** modifying the noun "book".
    *   If removed, the sentence "The book on the shelf in the drawing room is the one that you gave me" remains grammatically sound.
    *   The sources explicitly state that a prepositional phrase can function as an **adjunct of a noun phrase**.
    *   Therefore, this is the **first adjunct**.

4.  **"on the shelf"**: This is another **prepositional phrase** modifying the noun "book", indicating its location.
    *   If removed (along with "with the blue cover"), the sentence "The book in the drawing room is the one that you gave me" is still grammatical.
    *   Like the previous phrase, it adds optional, descriptive information about the noun.
    *   Therefore, this is the **second adjunct**.

5.  **"in the drawing room"**: This is a third **prepositional phrase** further modifying the noun "book", specifying another aspect of its location.
    *   If removed (along with the other modifying phrases), the core sentence "The book is the one that you gave me" stands.
    *   This also provides optional, descriptive information about the noun.
    *   Therefore, this is the **third adjunct**.

In conclusion, the sentence contains three distinct prepositional phrases that act as adjuncts, providing additional, non-essential information about the noun "book".

The correct answer is **C) 3**.

**6**. 'Documentaries about animals which highlight their rapidly-changing habitats are of the utmost importance in order to be able to prevent environmental destruction.' This sentence has 4 clauses.

**A**. True

**B**. False
{{< /border >}}

{{< border type="tip" title="Explanation" >}}
The statement "This sentence has 4 clauses" is **B. False**.

Let's break down the sentence to identify its clauses based on the definitions provided in the sources and our conversation history:

*   A **clause** is a grammatical unit that must contain a **subject** and a **verb**. Crucially, a clause usually has "some verb in it, some auxiliary in it, some tense in it, subject and etc.".
*   An **independent clause** (also known as a **main clause** or a **matrix clause**) has "independent status" and can "stand alone as a complete thought or sentence". It does not depend on any other clause.
*   A **subordinate clause** (also called an **embedded clause**) is "embedded within another sentence" and "does not have independent status". It is dependent on the main clause for its full meaning. Subordinate clauses can be nominal, adjectival, or adverbial in nature. An **adjectival (relative) clause**, for instance, modifies a noun and often begins with a relative pronoun like "which" or "who".

Now, let's analyse the sentence: "**Documentaries about animals which highlight their rapidly-changing habitats are of the utmost importance in order to be able to prevent environmental destruction.**"

1.  **Independent Clause:**
    *   **"Documentaries... are of the utmost importance in order to be able to prevent environmental destruction."**
    *   The core subject is "Documentaries," and the finite verb is "are." This part forms a complete thought and can stand alone as a sentence. While it contains other modifying phrases ("about animals" and "in order to be able to prevent environmental destruction"), these are not clauses themselves. "About animals" is a prepositional phrase, and "in order to be able to prevent environmental destruction" is an **infinitive phrase of purpose**, which functions adverbially but does not contain a finite verb and subject to be a clause. The sources note that a prepositional phrase can be an adjunct and that adverbial phrases add additional information.

2.  **Subordinate (Adjectival/Relative) Clause:**
    *   **"which highlight their rapidly-changing habitats"**
    *   This clause begins with the relative pronoun "which", acting as its subject. Its verb is "highlight."
    *   It modifies the noun "animals" by providing additional, descriptive information about them.
    *   This clause cannot stand alone as a complete sentence; it is dependent on the main clause.

Therefore, the sentence contains **two clauses**: one independent clause and one subordinate adjectival clause. The other elements are phrases that modify parts of the main clause.

Since the sentence has two clauses, the statement that it has four clauses is **false**.

**7**. ‘The garba celebrations, which were held for a week, were astonishingly grand for a miniscule village which was located in the hinterlands of the state.’ This sentence has __ clauses in total.

**A**. 1

**B**. 2

**D**. 4
{{< /border >}}

{{< border type="tip" title="Explanation" >}}
The sentence **'The garba celebrations, which were held for a week, were astonishingly grand for a miniscule village which was located in the hinterlands of the state’** has **3 clauses** in total.

Let's break down the sentence to identify each clause:

1.  **Understanding a Clause**:
    *   A **clause** is a grammatical unit that must contain a **subject** and a **verb**. It typically has "some verb in it, some auxiliary in it, some tense in it, subject and etc.".

2.  **Identifying the Clauses**:

    *   **Clause 1: The Main Clause (Independent Clause)**
        *   **"The garba celebrations... were astonishingly grand for a miniscule village"**
        *   **Subject**: "The garba celebrations"
        *   **Finite Verb**: "were"
        *   An **independent clause** (also known as a **main clause** or a **matrix clause**) is a clause that has "independent status" and can "stand alone as a complete thought or sentence". If we consider this core part, "The garba celebrations were astonishingly grand for a miniscule village," it forms a complete sentence on its own.

    *   **Clause 2: Subordinate Adjectival (Relative) Clause**
        *   **"which were held for a week"**
        *   **Subject**: "which" (acting as a relative pronoun and the subject of this clause).
        *   **Finite Verb**: "were held" (passive voice).
        *   This clause modifies the noun "garba celebrations" by providing additional, descriptive information about them. A **subordinate clause** is "embedded within another sentence" and "does not have independent status". An **adjectival clause** (also called a **relative clause**) functions like an adjective, modifying a noun. Such clauses often begin with relative pronouns like "which" and typically occur to the right of the noun they modify.

    *   **Clause 3: Subordinate Adjectival (Relative) Clause**
        *   **"which was located in the hinterlands of the state"**
        *   **Subject**: "which" (acting as a relative pronoun and the subject of this clause).
        *   **Finite Verb**: "was located" (passive voice).
        *   This clause modifies the noun "miniscule village," further specifying its location. Similar to Clause 2, this is another adjectival clause, providing optional, descriptive information about the noun it modifies.

In summary, the sentence contains **one independent clause** and **two subordinate adjectival clauses**, resulting in a total of **3 clauses**.

**Identity the type of subordinate clause in the following sentences (8-10)**:

{{< border >}}
**8**. The house where we live has a lot of trees

**A**. Noun clause

**B**. Adjectival clause

**C**. Adverbial clause
{{< /border >}}

{{< border type="tip" title="Explanation" >}}
The sentence 'The house where we live has a lot of trees' contains an **adjectival clause**.

Here's a breakdown based on the provided sources:

*   A **clause** is a grammatical unit that includes a subject and a verb. In "where we live," "we" is the subject and "live" is the verb, confirming it is a clause.
*   A **subordinate clause** is "embedded within another sentence" and "does not have independent status". The clause "where we live" cannot stand alone as a complete sentence, indicating it is a subordinate clause.
*   Subordinate clauses can be of various types, including nominal, adjectival, or adverbial.
    *   **Nominal clauses** (noun clauses) function like a noun and can appear in subject or object positions. The clause "where we live" is not acting as the subject ("The house" is the subject) or the object ("a lot of trees" is the object) of the main verb "has."
    *   **Adverbial clauses** "give additional information" about the verb, adjective, or another adverb, and are often "adverbial in nature" as an adjunct. While "where we live" provides information, its primary function is not to modify the verb "has" in a general adverbial sense (like time, manner, or reason).
    *   **Adjectival clauses** (also known as **relative clauses**) function as an adjective and "occur to modify a noun". They "have the purpose to modify something," particularly a noun. They typically occur "to the right of a noun". The clause "where we live" directly modifies the noun "house," specifying *which* house is being referred to. The sources also explicitly mention that you can use "(a place) **where**..." for relative clauses, such as in "The hotel where we stayed was near the station" [102B]. This directly aligns with the structure and function in your example.

Therefore, "where we live" functions as an adjectival clause because it describes or qualifies the noun "house", similar to how an adjective would.

The final answer is $\boxed{B}$

**9**. The patient had died before the doctor came

**A**. Noun clause

**B**. Adjectival clause

**C**. Adverbial clause
{{< /border >}}

{{< border type="tip" title="Explanation" >}}
In the sentence 'The patient had died **before the doctor came**', the clause "**before the doctor came**" is an **adverbial clause** [C].

Here's a breakdown of why, based on the provided sources:

*   **What is a Clause?**
    *   A clause is a grammatical unit that **must contain a subject and a verb**. In "before the doctor came," "the doctor" is the subject and "came" is the verb, confirming it is a clause.
    *   It is a **subordinate clause** because it is "embedded within another sentence" and "does not have independent status"; it cannot stand alone as a complete thought.

*   **Why it is an Adverbial Clause:**
    *   **Adverbial clauses** "give additional information". They often express *when*, *where*, or *how* an action is performed. The clause "before the doctor came" provides information about the **time** the patient had died.
    *   The sources explicitly list "When..." clauses and "before..." clauses as examples of adverbial clauses. For instance, "When I went out, it was raining" is given as an example of a sentence with an adverbial clause indicating time. Similarly, "Always look both ways before you cross the road" illustrates the use of "before" introducing an adverbial clause.
    *   If a clause "is simply giving an additional information," it is adverbial. This clause adds extra, non-essential information about *when* the main event occurred.

*   **Why it is not a Noun Clause or Adjectival Clause:**
    *   **Nominal (Noun) Clauses** function like a noun, occurring typically in a subject or object position. The clause "before the doctor came" is not acting as the subject or object of the main verb "had died."
    *   **Adjectival (Relative) Clauses** modify a noun. This clause modifies the entire action of "had died" by specifying its time, rather than describing a particular noun in the sentence.

Therefore, the clause "before the doctor came" serves to modify the verb phrase "had died" by specifying the time of the action, which is the function of an adverbial clause.

**10**. Whoever sent us this letter should have signed his or her name.

**A**. Noun clause

**B**. Adjectival clause

**C**. Adverbial clause
{{< /border >}}

{{< border type="tip" title="Explanation" >}}
In the sentence "**Whoever sent us this letter** should have signed his or her name," the clause "**Whoever sent us this letter**" is a **Noun clause**.

Here's why, drawing on the information from the sources and our conversation history:

*   **Understanding a Clause**: A clause is a grammatical unit that **must contain a subject and a verb**. In "Whoever sent us this letter," "Whoever" acts as the subject of the clause, and "sent" is its verb. This confirms it is a clause.
*   **Subordinate Clauses**: This clause is a **subordinate clause** (also called an embedded clause) because it "does not have independent status" and is "embedded within another sentence".
*   **Function of the Clause**: Subordinate clauses can be "nominal in nature, which work like a noun in place of a noun". Specifically, **nominal clauses** (or noun clauses) "can occur at a subject position or an object position". The sources further clarify that "a subordinate clause as a noun clause can be the subject, can be the subject of the sentence also". In this sentence, the entire clause "Whoever sent us this letter" functions as the **subject** of the main verb phrase "should have signed."

Since the clause is performing the function of a noun by acting as the subject of the main sentence, it is classified as a noun clause.
