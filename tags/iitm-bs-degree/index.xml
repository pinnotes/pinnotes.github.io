&lt;h2&gt;IIT Madras BS Degree in Data Science and Applications: Frequently Asked Questions&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="iit-madras-bs-degree-in-data-science-and-applications-frequently-asked-questions"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a href="#iit-madras-bs-degree-in-data-science-and-applications-frequently-asked-questions" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is the IIT Madras BS Degree in Data Science and Applications programme?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="what-is-the-iit-madras-bs-degree-in-data-science-and-applications-programme"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a href="#what-is-the-iit-madras-bs-degree-in-data-science-and-applications-programme" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an online programme offering various exit points, allowing learners to earn a Foundation level certificate, Diploma in Programming, Diploma in Data Science, a BSc degree in Programming and Data Science, or a BS degree in Data Science and Applications from IIT Madras. The course content is delivered online, but monthly quizzes and final semester exams require in-person attendance at designated centres. The programme is open to individuals of any background and age, with no geographical limitations on learning besides exam centre travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are the different levels and qualifications offered within the programme?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="what-are-the-different-levels-and-qualifications-offered-within-the-programme"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a href="#what-are-the-different-levels-and-qualifications-offered-within-the-programme" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The programme is structured in four levels, each building upon the previous one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 1: The Foundation level:&lt;/strong&gt; Comprises 8 foundational courses (32 credits) covering subjects like English, Mathematics, Statistics, Computational Thinking, and Introduction to Python. Successful completion earns a Foundation level certificate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 2: Diploma level:&lt;/strong&gt; Includes two distinct diplomas: Diploma in Programming and Diploma in Data Science. Each diploma consists of 6 courses (23 credits) and 2 project courses (4 credits), totalling 54 credits for both diplomas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 3: BSc Degree level:&lt;/strong&gt; Requires completion of the Foundation and Diploma levels, totalling 114 credits. This level includes mandatory core courses, a professional growth course, and allows for some credits from NPTEL courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 4: BS Degree level:&lt;/strong&gt; Requires completion of 142 credits, building upon the BSc level. This level offers options for apprenticeship credits and includes mandatory level 4 courses in both programming and data science streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How can someone gain admission to the programme?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="how-can-someone-gain-admission-to-the-programme"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a href="#how-can-someone-gain-admission-to-the-programme" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two main entry pathways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regular Entry into Foundation level:&lt;/strong&gt; Applicants must pass a Qualifier exam. Eligibility for the Qualifier exam is based on achieving minimum average scores in weekly assignments in the four initial subjects over a 4-week period. The Qualifier exam itself requires meeting minimum individual subject cut-offs and a total cut-off score. Qualifier scores are valid for 3 subsequent terms for registration to the Foundation level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JEE-based Entry into Foundation Level:&lt;/strong&gt; Students who have qualified for the JEE Advanced Exams can gain direct entry into the Foundation level. They need to apply through the Qualifier process and provide valid proof of their JEE Advanced eligibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there is a &lt;strong&gt;Direct Entry into Diploma programme&lt;/strong&gt; pathway primarily aimed at working professionals or those with existing fundamentals. This requires completing 2 years of any undergraduate degree programme and passing a separate Direct Admission to Diploma (DAD) qualifier exam for either the Diploma in Programming or the Diploma in Data Science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are the fees for the programme, and are there any fee waivers?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="what-are-the-fees-for-the-programme-and-are-there-any-fee-waivers"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a href="#what-are-the-fees-for-the-programme-and-are-there-any-fee-waivers" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fees vary depending on the level of study and the number of credits taken in a term. The Qualifier exam has a non-refundable entry fee of Rs. 3000, with suitable waivers available. Fee waivers are offered based on the learner&amp;rsquo;s category (General, EWS, OBC, SC/ST, PwD) and family income. The programme is designed with lower first-year fees to encourage initial participation. Specific fee structures for each level and cost per credit are detailed in the handbook, including separate facilitation fees for students taking exams outside India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How is the Credit Clearing Capability (CCC) determined, and how does it affect course registration?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="how-is-the-credit-clearing-capability-ccc-determined-and-how-does-it-affect-course-registration"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a href="#how-is-the-credit-clearing-capability-ccc-determined-and-how-does-it-affect-course-registration" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CCC determines the maximum number of courses a learner is permitted to register for in a term. For the first term, it is decided by Qualifier marks. From the second term onwards, the CCC is calculated based on the average marks of courses passed in the preceding terms. If a learner fails all courses in a term, their CCC for the next term is set to 2. While the CCC is enforced for most learners, for students in the Foundation level from May 2024 onwards, the CCC will be a recommendation to allow them flexibility in meeting new course completion checkpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is the academic calendar and how does course registration work?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="what-is-the-academic-calendar-and-how-does-course-registration-work"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a href="#what-is-the-academic-calendar-and-how-does-course-registration-work" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The academic year is divided into three terms: January-April, May-August, and September-December. Foundation, Diploma level courses, and mandatory BSc level courses are offered every term. Learners can register for courses based on their CCC, subject to fulfilling prerequisite requirements. Students cannot register for courses across different levels in the same term. The minimum duration for completing any level is 36 months (3 years/9 terms), and the entire programme must be completed within 96 months (8 years/24 terms). Course registration is done online, and payment is made per credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How are courses graded and what are the passing criteria?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="how-are-courses-graded-and-what-are-the-passing-criteria"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a href="#how-are-courses-graded-and-what-are-the-passing-criteria" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courses are graded using an absolute grading system based on the Total Course Score (T), which is the sum of all assessment components. A candidate passes a course if their Total Course Score is 40/100 or higher. Letter grades from S (highest) to E (lowest passing grade) and U (fail) are awarded based on score ranges. GPA is calculated per term, and CGPA is computed for all unique courses completed, with the best grade being considered in case of multiple attempts. Project courses have specific grading criteria, including L1 and L2 vivas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are the policies regarding repeating or dropping courses and academic progression?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="what-are-the-policies-regarding-repeating-or-dropping-courses-and-academic-progression"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a href="#what-are-the-policies-regarding-repeating-or-dropping-courses-and-academic-progression" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learners can repeat a course for improvement in grades any number of times, with the highest score being considered for CGPA calculation (though repeating for improvement after completing diplomas may not count for prizes). Repeating a course for improvement incurs double the regular course fee. Learners can also repeat courses if they receive a failing grade (U, WA, WQ) or an Incomplete (I) grade. An Incomplete grade may allow for a Make-Up Exam in the subsequent term instead of repeating the entire course. Dropping a course is permitted within the first 4 weeks of a term, with a portion of the fee being retained as an administrative charge and the rest credited to the student wallet for future course registration. Specific checkpoints and maximum time limits for completing each level are in place, with failure to meet these potentially leading to academic probation or removal from the programme. To progress to the BSc level from May 2024 onwards, students must achieve a CGPA of 6.0 or higher at the end of the two diplomas and a CGPA of 7.0 or higher in all completed diploma level projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly. The IIT Madras BS in Data Science &amp;amp; Applications programme offers multiple pathways for students to enter, primarily through a Qualifier process or direct entry routes based on previous qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the ways students can enter the programme, based on the provided sources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regular Entry into Foundation Level (via Qualifier Exam)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is a primary method for most applicants to enter the programme.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eligibility to Apply for the Qualifier Exam:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applicants must have studied Mathematics and English in Class 10.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyone who has passed Class 12 or equivalent is eligible to apply, regardless of age or academic background. Those who qualify can join immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;School students who have appeared for their Class 11 final exams can also apply, irrespective of their stream or board. If they qualify, they can join after passing Class 12.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Qualifier Process:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular entry applicants must undergo a 4-week process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access is provided to content for four Foundation level courses: English 1, Maths-1, Statistics-1, and Computational Thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weekly graded assignments are released and must be submitted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eligibility to Appear for the Qualifier Exam:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on the average score of weekly assignments in each of the four subjects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimum average assignment scores are required to get the hall ticket for the in-person proctored exam. These minimums vary by candidate category (General, SC/ST/PwD, OBC-NCL/EWS).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passing the Qualifier Exam:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An in-person proctored exam is conducted at the end of the 4 weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To pass, a learner must obtain marks equal to or greater than the individual subject cut-off &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the total score across all subjects must be greater than the total cut-off. The cut-off marks are specified based on the candidate&amp;rsquo;s category.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upon Qualification:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Candidates who qualify are intimated via email, WhatsApp, and within their portal login. An admission letter is also provided.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is important to note&lt;/strong&gt; that passing the Qualifier is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; admission to a degree programme. It makes the learner eligible to register for the set of Foundation courses. Diplomas or degrees are earned only by accruing the requisite number of credits by completing prescribed courses and satisfying other mandatory criteria.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The qualifier score is valid for the three subsequent terms for registration to the Foundation level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Candidates who qualify in the first attempt within a term can register for courses in the same term (where the qualifier score counts as Quiz 1) or in the next two terms. Those who qualify in the second attempt within a term can &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; register from the subsequent term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reattempting the Qualifier:&lt;/strong&gt; There are two attempts within any term. Candidates who were eligible for the hall ticket but were absent or failed the first attempt can re-attempt the exam by paying a fee. Candidates who did not become eligible for the qualifier exam must redo the 4-week process and pay the full fees for a fresh application in a subsequent term. There is no limit on the number of times a candidate can attempt the qualifier process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JEE-based Entry into Foundation Level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This offers a &lt;strong&gt;direct entry&lt;/strong&gt; into the Foundation level for students who have qualified for the JEE Advanced Exams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The validity of this direct entry is for the three terms following the release of the JEE Advanced Eligibility list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Process:&lt;/strong&gt; Applicants apply to the Qualifier process, indicate their eligibility for JEE Advanced, and upload valid proof.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outcome:&lt;/strong&gt; If the proof is valid, the candidate is declared eligible to join the Foundational level courses, issued an admission letter, and can directly register for courses with a Credit Clearing Capability (CCC) of 4. If the proof is invalid, the candidate is moved to the regular entry category and must go through the standard qualifier process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direct Entry into Diploma Programme (DAD)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This pathway is designed for working professionals or learners who already possess the fundamental knowledge taught in the Foundation level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The entry point is directly into the Diploma level. The potential exit point from this route is one or both Diplomas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eligibility to Apply:&lt;/strong&gt; Students who have completed two years in any undergraduate degree programme are permitted to apply for direct entry to the Diploma level. Proof, such as their second-year marksheet or higher, must be submitted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualifying Process:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A separate Direct Admission to Diploma (DAD) qualifier exam is conducted. These exams happen three times a year, coinciding with the programme&amp;rsquo;s end-term examinations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are separate DAD qualifier exams for the Diploma in Programming (DAD-DP) and the Diploma in Data Science (DAD-DS).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The DAD-DP qualifier is a 3-hour exam covering English, Aptitude, and 6 weeks of Maths 1 content. Students who pass this would then study Computational Thinking, Introduction to Python before starting the Programming Diploma subjects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The DAD-DS qualifier is a 4-hour exam covering English, Maths 1, Statistics 1, and Python programming. Students who pass this would then start with Maths 2 and Statistics 2 before continuing with Data Science Diploma subjects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Candidates must cross the defined cut-off marks in the DAD Qualifier exam to be eligible. Cut-off marks vary by category.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passing the DAD-DS qualifier makes a student eligible to pursue the Diploma in Programming without a further qualifier, but passing the DAD-DP qualifier requires sitting the DAD-DS qualifier if the student wishes to pursue the Diploma in Data Science (because Maths 1 and Statistics 1 were not part of the DAD-DP exam).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, students can initially enter the IITM BS programme through a regular Qualifier exam process for the Foundation level, a direct entry route into the Foundation level for eligible JEE Advanced candidates, or a direct entry route into the Diploma level via a separate DAD qualifier exam.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>IIT Madras Data Science Programme:- Timeline and Cast</title><link>/blog/iit/iitm-bs-degree-timeline/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/iit/iitm-bs-degree-timeline/</guid><description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Programme Structure and Levels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 1: The Foundation Level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the initial entry point for most applicants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It comprises 8 courses: English 1, English 2, Mathematics 1, Mathematics 2, Statistics 1, Statistics 2, Computational Thinking, and Introduction to Python.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Successful completion of these 8 courses is required to register for Year 2 Diploma level courses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Foundation level accounts for 32 credits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learners can earn a Foundation level certificate upon completion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 2: Diploma Level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This level includes two distinct Diplomas: Diploma in Programming and Diploma in Data Science.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diploma in Programming:&lt;/strong&gt; Consists of 6 courses (23 credits) and 2 project courses (4 credits). Courses include Database Management Systems (DBMS), Programming Data Structures and Algorithms using Python (PDSA), Java programming, System Commands, Application Development - 1, and Application Development - 2, plus project courses in Application Development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diploma in Data Science:&lt;/strong&gt; Consists of 6 courses (23 credits) and 2 project courses (4 credits). Courses include Machine Learning Foundations (MLF), Machine Learning Techniques (MLT), Machine Learning Practice (MLP), Business Data Management (BDM), Business Analytics (BA), and Tools in Data Science (TDS), plus project courses in Business Data Management and Machine Learning Practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each diploma comprises a total of 27 credits (23 course credits + 4 project credits).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The combined Diploma level totals 54 credits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learners can earn a Diploma in Programming, a Diploma in Data Science, or both upon completion of the respective requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Successful completion of &lt;strong&gt;all 8 Foundation courses and the 12 Diploma level courses + 4 project courses&lt;/strong&gt; is necessary before registering for Year 3 Degree level courses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 3: BSc Degree Level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This level requires a total of 28 credits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It includes mandatory core pairs (Software Engineering, Software Testing, Artificial Intelligence, and Deep Learning) and a mandatory course: Strategies for Professional Growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A maximum of 4 credits can be obtained from NPTEL courses in the technical bucket.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The total credits required to graduate with the BSc degree are 114. Learners become eligible for the BSc degree upon completing 114 credits according to norms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 4: BS Degree Level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the final level, requiring a total of 28 credits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It offers the option of an Apprenticeship, allowing learners to earn 0, 4, 8, or 12 credits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is mandatory to earn 4 credits from the HS/MG stream, which can be from NPTEL or programme electives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mandatory completion of 2 Level 4 courses in the programming stream and 2 Level 4 courses in the data science stream is required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The total credits required to graduate with the BS degree are 142. Learners become eligible for the BS degree upon completing 142 credits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Minor in Economics and Finance can be earned by completing 2 mandatory courses (Corporate Finance and Managerial Economics) and one elective course, credited within the 142 credits for the BS degree. The Minor can only be earned with the BS degree.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progression Through Levels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entry into Foundation Level:&lt;/strong&gt; Applicants must generally pass a Qualifier exam. There is also a direct entry route for students who have qualified for the JEE Advanced Exams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progression from Foundation to Diploma Level:&lt;/strong&gt; Requires successful completion of all courses in the Foundation level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progression from Diploma to BSc Degree Level:&lt;/strong&gt; Learners who successfully complete all courses in the Foundation and Diploma programmes become eligible for admission to the degree level if they satisfy the prescribed/regulatory criteria. For students admitted to the Diploma level from May 2024 onwards, eligibility requires securing a CGPA of 6.0 or higher at the end of the two diplomas (including Foundation and Diploma courses/projects) &lt;strong&gt;AND&lt;/strong&gt; a CGPA of 7.0 or higher specifically in all diploma-level projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progression from BSc to BS Degree Level:&lt;/strong&gt; Students who complete 114 credits as per the norms are eligible for the BSc degree and can then continue onto the BS level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Credit Definition:&lt;/strong&gt;
Credits in this programme are based on the UGC system, where &lt;strong&gt;14 hours of learner engagement counts as 1 credit&lt;/strong&gt;. This is equivalent to 3 credits in the current IITM campus Credit system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entry and Exit Points:&lt;/strong&gt;
The programme is designed with two entry points (Regular Entry into Foundation, JEE-based Entry into Foundation, and Direct Entry into Diploma) and four potential exit points, allowing learners to leave with course certificates, one or both diplomas, a BSc degree, or the final BS degree. It is important to note that passing the Qualifier exam allows entry into the Foundation courses, not automatic admission to a degree programme; diplomas or degrees are earned by accruing the requisite credits and satisfying mandatory criteria.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
