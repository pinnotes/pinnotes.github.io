1. Graphs and General Graph Problems 1.1 Introduction Concept: Graphs model pairwise relationships between objects. Example: Social networks (people as vertices, friendships as edges), communication networks (devices as vertices, links as edges)1. Key Idea: Graphs abstract real-world situations by focusing on connections rather than physical layout. 1.2 Graph Definition: A graph $ G = (V, E) $ consists of a set of vertices (nodes) $ V $ and a set of edges $ E $ connecting pairs of vertices. Example: $ V = {A, B, C, D, E, F, G} $, $ E = {(A,B), (A,C), (B,D), (B,E), (C,F), (C,G)} $1. Undirected Graph: Edges have no direction; if $(A, B)$ is present, so is $(B, A)$ implicitly. 1.3 Types of Graphs Simple Graph: No loops or multiple edges between the same pair of vertices. Directed Graph: Edges have direction; $(A, B)$ does not imply $(B, A)$. Undirected Graph: All edges are bidirectional. Complete Graph: Every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge. Example: A complete graph with 4 vertices has every vertex connected to every other vertex. 1.4 Paths and Reachability Path: A sequence of vertices connected by edges. Example: $ A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C \rightarrow D $ is a path from $ A $ to $ D $1. Reachability: Vertex $ u $ is reachable from $ v $ if there is a path from $ v $ to $ u $.

1. Graphs and General Graph Problems 1.1 Introduction Concept: Graphs model pairwise relationships between objects. Example: Social networks (people as vertices, friendships as edges), communication networks (devices as vertices, links as edges)1. Key Idea: Graphs abstract real-world situations by focusing on connections rather than physical layout. 1.2 Graph Definition: A graph $ G = (V, E) $ consists of a set of vertices (nodes) $ V $ and a set of edges $ E $ connecting pairs of vertices. Example: $ V = {A, B, C, D, E, F, G} $, $ E = {(A,B), (A,C), (B,D), (B,E), (C,F), (C,G)} $1. Undirected Graph: Edges have no direction; if $(A, B)$ is present, so is $(B, A)$ implicitly. 1.3 Types of Graphs Simple Graph: No loops or multiple edges between the same pair of vertices. Directed Graph: Edges have direction; $(A, B)$ does not imply $(B, A)$. Undirected Graph: All edges are bidirectional. Complete Graph: Every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge. Example: A complete graph with 4 vertices has every vertex connected to every other vertex. 1.4 Paths and Reachability Path: A sequence of vertices connected by edges. Example: $ A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C \rightarrow D $ is a path from $ A $ to $ D $1. Reachability: Vertex $ u $ is reachable from $ v $ if there is a path from $ v $ to $ u $. Example: In a social network, if Alice is connected to Bob, who is connected to Charlie, Alice is reachable from Charlie via Bob. 1.5 More on Graphs 1.5.1 Graph Coloring Definition: Assign colors to vertices so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. Chromatic Number: Minimum number of colors needed. Example: Scheduling classes so that conflicting classes (edges) are not at the same time (color). Result: 2 colors may suffice for some graphs1. Related Question: What is the minimum number of colors required for a given graph? Answer: Depends on the graph; for the example in the PDF, it is 2. 1.5.2 Vertex Cover Definition: A set of vertices such that every edge is incident to at least one vertex in the set. Example: In a graph, ${2,4,5}$ may be a vertex cover1. Related Question: Find a vertex cover for a given graph. Answer: For the example, ${2,4,5}$ is a vertex cover. 1.5.3 Independent Set Definition: A set of vertices where no two are adjacent. Example: ${1,4,6}$ may be a maximum independent set1. Related Question: Find a maximum independent set. Answer: For the example, ${1,4,6}$ is a maximum independent set. 1.5.4 Matching Definition: A set of edges without common vertices. Example: ${(1,2), (3,4), (5,6)}$ is a matching1. Related Question: Find a maximum matching. Answer: For the example, ${(1,2), (3,4), (5,6)}$ is a maximum matching. 1.6 Representing Graphs 1.6.1 Adjacency Matrix Definition: A square matrix where $ A_{ij} = 1 $ if there is an edge between vertices $ i $ and $ j $, else 0. Example: $$ A = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} $$ Related Question: Find the adjacency matrix for a given graph.

Example: Starting from vertex 1, BFS visits: 1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 6, 71. Applications: Shortest path in unweighted graphs. Related Question: Draw the BFS tree starting from vertex $ E $. Answer: The tree will show $ E $ connected to its neighbors, then their neighbors, etc. 1.8 Depth-First Search (DFS) Algorithm: Explore as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Example: Starting from vertex 4, DFS may visit: 4, 0, 1, 2, 31. Applications: Topological sorting, strongly connected components, maze solving. Related Question: Draw the DFS tree starting from vertex $ E $. Answer: The tree will show a path as deep as possible before backtracking. 1.9 Degree of a Vertex Definition: Number of edges incident to a vertex (undirected graph). Example: In a complete graph with 4 vertices, each vertex has degree 3. Related Question: What is the degree of each vertex in a given graph? Answer: For the complete graph, all degrees are 3. 1.10 Indegrees and Outdegrees Indegree: Number of edges entering a vertex (directed graph). Outdegree: Number of edges leaving a vertex (directed graph). Example: For a directed graph, sum of indegrees equals sum of outdegrees. Related Question: What are the indegree and outdegree of each vertex? Answer: For the example, indegree sequence is (1,1,1,0), outdegree is (1,2,1,0). 1.11 Problems Example Question: Find the shortest path connecting two people in a social network.

DAGs, Topological Sorting, and Longest Path 2.1 Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) Definition: Directed graph with no directed cycles. Example: Task dependencies in project scheduling. Related Question: Why is a given graph not a DAG? Answer: Because it contains a directed cycle. 2.2 Topological Sorting Definition: Linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge $(u, v)$, $u$ comes before $v$.

Related Question: Find a topological sorting for a given DAG. Answer: $A, B, D, E, C, F$ is one possible order. 2.3 Longest Path in a DAG Algorithm: Topologically sort the graph, then for each vertex, update the longest path to its neighbors. Example: In a DAG, the longest path can be found using dynamic programming after topological sort1. 2.4 Transitive Closure Definition: A graph that includes an edge $(u, v)$ if there is a path from $u$ to $v$ in the original graph. Example: If there are paths $A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C$, then the transitive closure includes $A \rightarrow C$1. Related Question: Find the transitive closure of a given graph. Answer: Add edges for all reachable pairs. 2.5 Matrix Multiplication Adjacency Matrix: Represents graph connectivity. Reachability Matrix: $A^k$ gives paths of length $k$. Transitive Closure Matrix: $A + A^2 + A^3 + \ldots + A^n$. Example: For a graph, compute $A^2$ to find paths of length 21. Related Question: Compute $A^2$ for a given adjacency matrix.

Answer: As above. 3.4 Spanning Trees Definition: A subgraph that is a tree and connects all vertices. Example: A tree connecting all cities with minimum total road length1. 3.5 Prim’s Algorithm Algorithm: Greedily adds the shortest edge connecting a tree vertex to a non-tree vertex. Example: Starting from $A$, add edges $(A,C)$, $(C,E)$, etc., to form a minimum spanning tree1. Related Question: Find the minimum spanning tree using Prim’s algorithm. Answer: Add edges in order of smallest weight, avoiding cycles. 3.6 Kruskal’s Algorithm Algorithm: Adds edges in order of increasing weight, skipping those that form cycles.

Activity Questions 1.2</h2><p class=chapter-description>1. Which of the following option(s) is(are) true? Solution Based on the sources and our conversation history, we can determine which of the given inequalities between fractions are true by finding a common denominator and comparing the numerators. Rational numbers, which include fractions, can be written in the form p/q. To compare two fractions which have different denominators, there is no way to directly compare them. The only way is to convert them into equivalent fractions such that they have the same denominator. A number that is a multiple of both denominators can be used as the common denominator. Once the denominators are the same, you can add the numerators, or in this case, compare them.</p></li></a><style>.gradient-text{background:linear-gradient(90deg,#ff7e5f,#feb47b);-webkit-background-clip:text;-webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;margin:0 .25rem;list-style-type:decimal-leading-zero}.chapter-image{display:none;width:100px;border-radius:8px;margin-right:10px;float:left;object-fit:cover;aspect-ratio:4/3}.chapter-item{list-style-type:none;margin:20px 0;padding:1.5rem;background-color:#fff;border-radius:8px;font-size:17px;box-shadow:0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.1);transition:all .3s ease}.chapter-item:hover{background-color:#f9f9f9;border-color:#d0d0d0;transform:translateY(-2px);box-shadow:0 6px 10px rgba(0,0,0,.15);cursor:pointer}.chapter-emoji{position:absolute;left:-12px;transform:translateY(-100%);font-size:28px;z-index:1}.chapter-item{position:relative}.chapter-title{font-weight:700;margin:0 0 5px;color:#333;font-size:large}.chapter-description{margin:0;color:#666;font-size:14px;white-space:pre-wrap;overflow:hidden;text-overflow:ellipsis;display:-webkit-box;-webkit-line-clamp:2;-webkit-box-orient:vertical;line-height:1.5rem;max-height:3rem}.chapter-item:focus-within{outline:2px solid #0078d4;outline-offset:2px}.chapter-item:hover .chapter-title{color:#0078d4}html[class~=dark]{.chapter-item { color: #ffffff; background-color: #1e293b; box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); } .chapter-item:hover { box-shadow: 0 6px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7); } .chapter-title { color: #ffffff; } .chapter-description { color: #dddddd; }}@media(min-width:769px){.chapter-image{display:block}}@media(max-width:768px){.chapter-image{display:none}}</style><a href=/notes/iit-madras/data-science-and-application/foundational-level/english-2/week-1/aq1.3/><li class=chapter-item><img class=chapter-image src=/images/svg/circle-gradient.svg alt="Activity Questions 1.3" loading=lazy width=100 height=100 style=border-radius:8px;margin-right:10px;float:left><h2 class="chapter-title mona-sans"><span class=gradient-text>07</span>
