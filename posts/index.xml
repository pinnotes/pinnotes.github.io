&lt;h1>Quantitative Aptitude Topics Explained with Examples and Solutions&lt;/h1>&lt;p>Below is a simple, exam-ready explanation of each major quantitative aptitude topic, including clear examples and step-by-step solutions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>1. Number System&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="1-number-system">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#1-number-system" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Definition:&lt;/strong> Deals with types, properties, and rules of numbers: natural numbers, integers, fractions, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Example Question:&lt;/strong>
Which of the following is an even number: 6, 9, 13, 17?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Solution:&lt;/strong>
Even numbers are divisible by 2.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>6 ÷ 2 = 3 (even)
&lt;strong>Answer:&lt;/strong> 6 is an even number.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2>2. HCF &amp;amp; LCM&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="2-hcf--lcm">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#2-hcf--lcm" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Definition:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>HCF (Highest Common Factor):&lt;/strong> Largest number dividing two or more numbers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>LCM (Lowest Common Multiple):&lt;/strong> Smallest number divisible by given numbers.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Example Question:&lt;/strong>
Find the HCF and LCM of 12 and 18.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Solution:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Factors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18
HCF = 6&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Multiples of 12: 12, 24, 36, 48&amp;hellip;
Multiples of 18: 18, 36, 54&amp;hellip;
LCM = 36&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>3. Ratio &amp;amp; Proportion&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="3-ratio--proportion">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#3-ratio--proportion" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Definition:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Ratio:&lt;/strong> Comparison of two quantities (e.g., 2:3).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Proportion:&lt;/strong> Equality of two ratios (e.g., 2:3 = 4:6).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Example Question:&lt;/strong>
Divide ₹1200 between A and B in the ratio 2:3.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Solution:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Total parts = 2 + 3 = 5&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A’s share = (2/5) × 1200 = ₹480&lt;/li>
&lt;li>B’s share = (3/5) × 1200 = ₹720&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2>4. Percentages&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="4-percentages">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#4-percentages" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Definition:&lt;/strong> A fraction or ratio out of 100.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Example Question:&lt;/strong>
What is 25% of 200?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Solution:&lt;/strong>
25% of 200 = (25/100) × 200 = 50&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>5. Average&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="5-average">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#5-average" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Definition:&lt;/strong> The sum of all values divided by the number of values.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Example Question:&lt;/strong>
Find the average of 5, 8, 10.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Solution:&lt;/strong>
Average = (5 + 8 + 10) / 3 = 23 / 3 = 7.67&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>6. Profit &amp;amp; Loss&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="6-profit--loss">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#6-profit--loss" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Definition:&lt;/strong> Related to buying and selling goods.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Formulas:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Profit = Selling Price (SP) – Cost Price (CP)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Loss = CP – SP&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Example Question:&lt;/strong>
Item bought for ₹100, sold for ₹120. Profit %?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Solution:&lt;/strong>
Profit = 120 – 100 = ₹20
% Profit = (Profit / CP) × 100 = (20/100) ×100 = 20%&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>7. Simple &amp;amp; Compound Interest&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="7-simple--compound-interest">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#7-simple--compound-interest" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Simple Interest (SI):&lt;/strong>
SI = (P × R × T) / 100
(P = principal, R = rate, T = years)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Compound Interest (CI):&lt;/strong>
CI = P × [(1 + R/100)^T – 1]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Example Question:&lt;/strong>
Find SI on ₹1,000 at 8% for 2 years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Solution:&lt;/strong>
SI = (1000 × 8 × 2) / 100 = 160&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>8. Simplification&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="8-simplification">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#8-simplification" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Definition:&lt;/strong> Simplifying arithmetic expressions using BODMAS rules.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Example Question:&lt;/strong>
Solve: 8 + 4 × 2&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Solution:&lt;/strong>
According to BODMAS (Multiplication before Addition):
= 8 + (4 × 2)
= 8 + 8 = 16&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>9. Time &amp;amp; Work&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="9-time--work">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#9-time--work" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Definition:&lt;/strong> Problems involving work done by people or machines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Example Question:&lt;/strong>
A can do a job in 12 days, B in 8 days. How long together?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Solution:&lt;/strong>
A&amp;rsquo;s 1 day work = 1/12; B&amp;rsquo;s = 1/8
Combined work/day = 1/12 + 1/8 = (2 + 3)/24 = 5/24
Total days = 24/5 = 4.8 days&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>10. Time, Speed &amp;amp; Distance&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="10-time-speed--distance">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#10-time-speed--distance" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Formula:&lt;/strong>
Speed = Distance / Time&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Example Question:&lt;/strong>
If a car travels 120km in 3hr, what is its speed?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Solution:&lt;/strong>
Speed = 120km / 3hr = 40km/hr&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>11. Fractions &amp;amp; Decimals&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="11-fractions--decimals">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#11-fractions--decimals" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Definition:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>Decimal:&lt;/strong> Fraction in decimal format (e.g., 0.75)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Example Question:&lt;/strong>
Convert 3/8 to decimal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Solution:&lt;/strong>
3 ÷ 8 = 0.375&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>12. Data Interpretation&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="12-data-interpretation">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#12-data-interpretation" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Definition:&lt;/strong> Analyzing data given in tables, graphs, charts.&lt;/p>
