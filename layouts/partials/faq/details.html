      <h4>Why is Raycast free for personal use?</h4>
      <span class="material-symbols-outlined">expand_more</span>
    </summary>
    <p>
      We think of Raycast as a productivity layer that everybody should use to
      get work done faster. To make it accessible, we don't charge for the
      individual plan. The plan covers all built-in extensions, such as
      Clipboard History, Calendar or Window Management and provides access to
      all public extensions built by our community.

      <h4>Can I have personal Extensions and Team Extensions?</h4>
      <span class="material-symbols-outlined">expand_more</span>
    </summary>
    <p>
      Yes, you can create personal Extensions that are personalized to you, and
      speed up your productivity, and have team Extensions that can be shared
      around in your organization for everyone to use. Team Extensions will be
      available in the Store command, behind a filter for your Team. This is
      where all of your Team Extensions will live, and where you can install
      them.
